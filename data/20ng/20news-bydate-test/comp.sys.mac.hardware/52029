Subject: Running Mathematica on a PB160?

Here's another question by a hesitant Powerbook purchaser.
I want to be able to run Mathematica and would like to hear some comments  
from the gallery about this. How much slower does the program run on a  
machine without an FPU (namely a PB160) versus a machine with an FPU  
(namely a PB170).  What types of calculations get bogged down the most. I  
primarily due moderately simple algebra, integrals which can be dealt with  
analytically and plotting including 3-d plots. I don't do a lot of  
numerical work. Would a PB160 with a lot of memory ( and the very nice  
video port ) be sufficient or should I really try to get an FPU for this  
type of work? Is a PB170 with 8Mb faster than a PB160 with 12 or 16Mb.
All comments appreciated.
