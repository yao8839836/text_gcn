Here's the scoop:

For the past two years, I have been using an SE/30 with a Sony 1304s and
a Lapis video card.  This past month, I bought a Quadra 800 and am now 
using the Sony on it.  My SE/30 has been shipped home to my father who
is planning on getting an Apple 14" monitor (The Trinitron one).  My
question is this:  What kind of power cord will he get with the Apple
monitor.  Does it come with two types?  As I recall, one can hook up the
power cord of an apple monitor to the back of a machine such as my 
Quadra 800.  However, for my father's SE/30, there is no extra plug which
allows use of the SE/30's power supply.  He needs to plug it into the
socket separately.  So...does the monitor come with a cable that will allow
him to do this?  Will have to buy a different cable?  IF yes, where can he
purchase such a cable? or apple kind enough to provide both types of cables?

Thanks in advance,
Derek
