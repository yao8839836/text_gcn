     Since Image Writer LQ was discontinued, there is no Apple Talk
     printer with 11"*15" continous paper printer.

     I would like to know is there are any possibility to connect
     an IBM compatible printer to an Apple Talk net directly (or 
     with a Net Serial hardware), and if I need any other software
     to do it.

I've have not found quite the solution yet. The following comes from
MacUser's MiniFinders:

The Grappler IIsp is a dot matrix-printer interface cartridge that
emulates the Imagewriter LQs. Includes networking and spooling
software that allows multiple users... $159 Orange Micro 714-779-2772 

If you find out any more information, please let me know because in
the future I have the same problem, or if anyone else has the
information please post. Thanks
