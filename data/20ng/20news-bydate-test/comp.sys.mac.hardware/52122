	For what it's worth, my experience has been that the educational
discount (which my S.O. has taken advantage of, as a teacher) is roughly
equivalent to the corporate discounts that I'm able to get as an employee of
a fairly large multi-state corporation, which is usually at least as good as
what one can get at one of the "discount" computer chains (e.g. CompUSA).
	For purposes of budget estimation around here, we usually just knock
around 20% off SRP.
