Subject: Problems with Laserwriter print driver and Printmonitor

We are having problems with our Laserwriter print drivers going bad on
various people's machines on our Appletalk network.  On our network, people
have 7.0, 7.01, and 7.1 versions of the Laserwriter print driver.  We have
been solving the problem by reinstalling the print driver, but it is
time-consuming and a real pain.

The Printmonitor software also seems to go bad frequently.  We have also
just been replacing it (over and over, it seems) to keep things running.

Does anyone out there have any ideas about what may be causing the printing
software to go bad?  Are there known INIT conflicts or network conflicts? 
I would appreciate communication about any similar experiences you may have
had or ideas you have.

You could send me an email directly to: karens@edc.org....

thanks....karen
