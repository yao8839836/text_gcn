Re: Methods for attaching heat sink to processor.

Go to Radio Shack and buy a tube of heat sink compound. It comes
in a little blue and white tube with a black screw on cap.  At
Radio Shack, it's catalog number 276-1372.  It's a mix of
silicone and zinc oxide, and conducts heat very well.  Plus, it's
tacky.

Usually, you would smear a bit between the chip and the sink, and then
bolt or clamp the sink down, but if you don't move your Mac, gravity
and the stickiness of the goo should be more than suffcient to hold
things in place.  Just make sure you remember it's in there, in case
you tilt your Mac and jar it hard enough to shake it loose.  You
wouldn't want a loose piece of metal running around inside your Mac.
