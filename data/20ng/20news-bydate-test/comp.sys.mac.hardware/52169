I guess he is right. Early versions of the RasterOps cards did not either,
but they fixed it, and people with problems can get a free ROM upgrade
from RasterOps.

Very easy. If you boot without the MODE32 control panel, then it will
disable (or rather not reinstall) the 32-bit clean patches. So when
you run OK you must be in 24-bit adressing mode. Check About this Macintosh
and see if you havce a 12+MB system.
