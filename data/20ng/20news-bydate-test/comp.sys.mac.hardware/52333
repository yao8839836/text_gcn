Yes, and one thing to think about is the pricing on the 160M harddrive 
configuration.  When I got my lowly classic II, the options were 40 or 80M
harddrives, and it was clear that buying another 40M of harddrive space 
would cost *much* more than the difference in price between the two config-
uartions.  There is an analogous break in the LCIII/80 and 160 prices, and 
you will not regret spending the extra money for a larger harddrive.  

Particularly if you ever wind up wanting to use SoftPC, which sets up a
several-MB (up to 30!) partition, or if you are generating large files 
with DTP software, or if you might ever want to check out a mac unix-like 
os, like MachTen, having the extra space will be helpful.  when you are 
pricing used IIci's, look at the harddrive size they come with, and how much
it would cost you to add more storage down the road... (Might be a 
useful bargaining strategy even if you see no reason to go over 80M, though
I must admit that I am such a packrat that within 6 months of getting my 
computer, I was backing up a lot of stuff to floppies that I rarely use to 
because I was running out of space, without having started using DTP stuff, 
softPC or trying any unix os!)
