Have anyone dealt with "Hardware that Fits" before.  I  have seen 
their ad in both MacWorld and MacUser and  decided  to  try  them 
when I needed a new disk. The  result  was  not satisfactory  and
I was just wondering if I was just an isolated case.

I like to send a letter to the president of "Hardware that Fits".
Do  anyone  know the address? Is it the same address as the one I
return the products to?
