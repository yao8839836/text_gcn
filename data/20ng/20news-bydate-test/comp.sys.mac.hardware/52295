Hi, I just test installed kanjitalk 6.07 on my IIci 
and got a black screen, a way sick looking mac icon, and when hitting the
programmers reset, a tone sequence that I guess is the infamous "tones of
death." 
I was able to reboot off a floppy, removed the japanese system, and
set up the system folder on the hard drive to get system 7.01 back.
Now have no overt problems with the mac.
Any idea what caused the tones?  I forget the numbers but 7fff comes to mind.
If it is some self diagnostic, why would an older system version catch it,
and not 7. ?
(I'll be moving up to 7.1 and worldscript by-and-by)
Thanks in advance,
Hiroki
