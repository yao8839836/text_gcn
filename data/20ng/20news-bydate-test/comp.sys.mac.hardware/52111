I read in a recent Tidbits(171-2?) about the possibility of putting
a 68030 in a PB100. I am interested in doing so, but would like
to know more about it. Does it involve just replacing the 68000 that
is on the daughterboard, or does it involve getting a new daughter-
board. Also, would the 68030 be able to run QT with the PB100's
screen(not pretty I know, but possible?) And of course, what would
the damage be ($). Any info would be appreciated.
Thanks in advance. Jay Fogel
