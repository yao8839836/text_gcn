    Performa 405 = LCII 4/80 with Monitor, modem and software.
    Performa 430 = LCII 4/120 w/ Monitor, modem and software.

    The Performas are made to be low-cost, widely distributed (sold at
Sears) home machines, not business machines. They were developed to
compete with the retail outlet home computer market.

    Sears is probably going to have the best price around, most of the
time, based on the number they can purchase and stuff like that.

    Not really. The newer Peformas (405, 430, 450) come with what is
really a third party monitor that Apple has put their name on and
called it the Performa Plus display. Essentially it is a VGA monitor,
quite cheap.
