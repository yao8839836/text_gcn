I need to add to your message.
I have a major problem on my hands.  I have a Rodime 60+ (series
RO3000T) external hard drive.  Rodime is out of business, 
and not writing any more drivers.  In particular, drivers 
compatable with system 7.1.  After talking to Rodime, 
they recommended the following Hard drive manufacturers 
and their driver software that were compatable:
 
SCSI Hard drive manufacturer            Driver Software
----------------------------            ----------------
FWB                                     Hard disk tool kit
FWB                                     Hard disk tool kit - personal
La Cie                                  Silverlining 5.2 or higher
Casa Blanca Driver Software             Drive7
 
If anybody has experience with these driver software packages, please reply.
If there is shareware out there, I would like to get my hands on it.  I would
much rather send a good developer the $25 or so, because most of the software
I mentioned, if purchased, would cost $125, $49, $149, and $49 respectively.

Thanks in advance.
