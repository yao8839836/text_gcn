[ This would make me a bit suspect of Mr. Ramsey's qualifications
as a self-styled "expert", in fact, when I read about anybody
using virtual memory regularly I kind of wonder ... ;-) ]

Yes, one can sometimes get away with running a newer ROM (of the 
correct size, obviously) in an older machine, but one should be 
prepared for problems if running software that checks for machine 
type rather than ROM trap availability and then draws incorrect 
conclusions when special-casing - especially timing-dependent
and driver-related stuff.

In this particular case I see no reason to go to the trouble 
of ROM-swapping.  The Apple 32-bit enabler has problems, but
MODE32 works just fine with 7.0, 7.0.1, and 7.1.

>Does anyone know of a source for these ROMs?  

Sure.  Buy a used IIci motherboard.  Call Pre-Owned Electronics,
Shreve, or other parts dealers (see the back of Computer Shopper
or one of the Mac trades for phone numbers) and ask for a price
on a IIci ROM.  Everything has a price.  If you happen to find
somebody who salvaged a IIci with a dead motherboard, you might
get a decent price.  There is probably a market for used mother-
boards as well, so they might sell a ROM anyway.

Ask for a quote and then try offering less?  Pre-Owned and
Shreve have been known to dicker.  Their ads in various trade
magazines often list considerably different prices for the 
same items, and their phone quotes tend to vary as well.

Still, I'm not aware of any technical reason for upgrading 
the ROM in a IIx.
