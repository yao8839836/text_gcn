I recently got a Centris 610 4/230 on my desk. It's a vast improvement on
my previous machine (a IIsi 5/40). However .....

I've encountered a problem with fonts ..

Entries in a Filemaker 2.0 database which looked fine when printed from my
previous mac using System 7.01 now look wierd !

Spacing between characters has increased greatly - causing lines to be
truncated. I'm using plain and bold Helvetica in various sizes - the
increase in character spacing seems to occur for all sizes and styles. 

I'm using a mixture of TrueType and Fixed-Size fonts - exactly as on my
IIsi - when things worked perfectly.

We've managed to get similar behaviour using Word 5.1.

Apple UK adopted their usual "friendly" approach and told us to call our
local dealer - God help us !!

Any ideas ??
