Um... they've sold the Cray. They realised that spending two years on
numbercrunching the finite stress analysis figures for the complex
injection-molded cases was not the way to go, and was holding up
development work.
Especially when the first FEA model for the portable left out the battery
cover, and it had to be redone. That's why the portable was about three
years late.

Designing metal cases is easier - they're managing with the Calculator DA,
now it can compute 45/100-0.45 correctly.

Any other suggestions?
