PSI makes an internal fax modem for the map portable (1-800-622-1722) but 
asks too much for it (retail $450). I'd buy an external and save about 
$350. 

there is a manufacturer that still makes INTERNAL HD's for the portable, 
they're listed in some of the catalog "magazines" for apple stuff you can 
find at bookstores. If I see it again I'll post it. But, again, you might 
want to just add a small lightweight external HD built for the 
powerbooks. You'd be able to use it with a new computer some day. Any 
other mac portable questions, I'll have to cry uncle.

Don't blame me. I voted for XXXXXXX.
