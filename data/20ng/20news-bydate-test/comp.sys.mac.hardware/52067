Hello!

I have a SE/30 and a Generation Systems 8bit PDS card for a 17"
screen.
It worked great until I upgraded from 5 to 20 mb ram.
Now with Sys7.1 and MODE32 or 32enabler it does not boot..

a tech support person said the card does not support these 32bit
fixes.

BUT: when pressing the shift key while booting (when the ext. monitor
goes black after having been grey) the system  SOMETIMES boots properly!!
and then works ok with the 20mb and full graphics.

WHAT's HAPPENING???

Thanks a lot for any advice!!!
please answer by mail.
