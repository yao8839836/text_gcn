My telephone line seems pretty stable and I have the Supra as well.  Works 
great but with every passing day I fall behind on how many great 14.4s are 
out.  Zoom is out of the question from what I'm hearing.  AT&T has a great 
product from what I hear and the Sportster is really cheap now too.

If you want to receive a fax, your computer will have to be on, but not 
the monitor and of course the modem.  You can set the number of rings that 
will receive the fax on a specific ring you set with Fax STF software.  
It's entirely up to you how to arrange that.  I've had faxes sent to me 
which is great but I've been home to set it.  I don't have a need to set 
fax receiving up all day.  Also I hear there is a device that can channel 
all incoming phone signals for about $70.  Rumor also that the phone 
company can hook you up with the same gizmo for about $5 if that's what 
you need.

Best of luck and write back if you'd like more feedback.
