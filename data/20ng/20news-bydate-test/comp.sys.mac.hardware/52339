Well,

    You can always try and find a PC dealer who sells guaranteed memory.
I work at a company growing at 40% a year, we have on order hundreds
of computers per year.  It never fails, machines come in with BAD SIMMS.
Now for those of you who are wondering just WHY your PC or MAC just crashed
I can tell you I always thought it was the incompetent ass who wrote or
designed the software.
    Well, I don't think that way anymore, especially with the results I
have gotten with replacing BAD SIMMS in my own machine and others at work.
The moral to this story is to MAKE SURE your memory is good.  I would
be willing to bet lots of you out there have SIMMS with either soft
or hard errors on them and you don't even know about it, but every once
in awhile those bad SIMMS just makes your life hell.
   
I just got plain SICK of dealing with peoples complaints that thier machine
just crashed and they lost thier work.  In case your wondering, or if you
haven't already guessed I work in an IS department.  Service is a do or die
perogative in this line of work, so the MORAL IS:  HAVE YOUR MEMORY TESTED
with a SIMM hardware tester...and NO I don't mean the simple little software
programs that you can run in your machine.  SIMMS are complicated little
beasts and they needs special hardware to test them effectively.

If any of you are interested in getting one of these nifty little devices
which are not cheap, write me back.  They make life a little bit easier, and
besides they pay for themselves in a short time from the loss of productivity
people would have to deal with when thier machine commits suicide.
