I read a great book about eye dominance several years ago. So there is one
book out there..at least one :).

There were several types of eye dominance. Where a person looks in their
memory usually indicates a type of eye dominanc Another type is related to
coordination activities like hitting a ball. Another for reading. 

I didn't read one that discussed prescription strength. Although people
with bad vision, near or far sighted would tend to depend on the stronger
eye.
