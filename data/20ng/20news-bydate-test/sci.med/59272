You might look for an allergy doctor in your area who uses sublingual
drops instead of shots for treatment. (You are given a small bottle of
antigens; 3 drops are placed under the tongue for 5 minutes.) My
allergy to bermuda grass was neutralized this way. Throughout the treatment
process I had to return to the doctor's office every month for re-testing
and a new bottle of antigens. After the allergy was completely neutralized
a bottle of maintenance antigens lasts me about 4 months (the sublingual
drops are then taken 3 times per week), and costs $20. So the cost is
less than shots and it is more convenient just to take the drops at home.
