the body will make fat out of carbohydrates if it needs them. Third, your
body, like most peoples, wasn't bred to live on a high fat, modern diet.
If you read texts about ancient and primative people you will read about
the luxury of eating fat, how people enjoyed it. This was because it was so
rare. Even cows didn't put out nearly the amount of butterfat in milk that
they do now.

are pregnant. If you are lucky you can work on getting rid of it after the
baby. (It is said that doctors have less gallbadder surgery than the rest
of the population, a good part of it is that they are willing to do the
dieting, etc that helps them avoid surgery. Also, I don't think the surgery
lets a person go back to eating a high fat diet. )
