Hi sci.med folks...

I would like to know anything you folks can tell me regarding Lithium.

I have a 10 year old son that lives with my ex-wife.  She has been having
difficulty with his behavior and has had him on Ritalin, Tofranil, and now
wants to try Lithuim at the local doctors suggestion.  I would like to 
know whatever is important that I should know.  I worry about this sort of
thing and would like pros/cons regarding Lithium therapy.

I have a booklet from the "Lithium Information Center" based at the 
University of Wisconsin, but feel that it is pro-lithium and would be
interested in comments from the "not necessarily PRO" side of the fence.

I am a concerned father and just wish to be well informed...

Thanks for any information you can provide.

Please email me directly...
