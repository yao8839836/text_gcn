I originally posted this to alt.suicide.holiday but it was recommended
that I try you guys instead:

My friend insists that Ny-Quil can be deadly if enough is taken -- he
suggested something like 20-30 of the Night-time gelcaps would do someone
in.  Being a NORMAL user of Ny-Quil :), I checked the 'ingredients' and
have a very hard time believing it.  They are:

250 g acetaminophen
30 mg Pseudoephedrine HCl
10 mg Dextromethorphan HBr
6.25 mg Doxylamine Succinate

(per softgel)

Can someone settle our bet (a package of Ny-Quil of course :) -- what 
effect would 20-30 of these babies have?
