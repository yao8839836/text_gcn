I'll agree with your wife.  While I was a student, I had doctors remove
rather surprising amounts of wax from my ears by flushing them out a couple
times, usually because they were examining my ears for some other reason, and
said something like "Gee, you've got a lot of wax in there".  In my case,
removal of these large wax buildups did noticeably improve my hearing, and
I've since gotten in the same habit as your wife of flushing them out with
warm water from a little rubber bulb every few months.  You can buy little
bulbs together with ear drops for this express purpose from the drug store -
I don't notice that the drops accomplish much of anything.

One question I do have - a doctor who flushed out my ears once also advocated
a drop of rubbing alcohol in them afterwards to flush out any remaining
trapped water - said he told swimmers to do this after swimming, too.  It
works, but it stings like the devil, so I've always been content to let any
water in my ears from swimming or flushing them out figure out how to get
out by itself if shaking my head a few times won't do the trick.  Any
comments?
