I think alot do it blindly because "Dad" had it done.  But there are many

Yeah...Right! (Sarchasm)

Oh YEAH ?

Scene: Navy boot camp

DI:		"Son, you smel awful! Dont you ever clean that thing?"
Recruit:	"No Sir !"
DI:		"Why the hell NOT!"
Recruit:	"Your not sposed to touch down there?"
DI:		"Why ?"
Recruit:	"Cause thats the eye of god down there, an' your not s'posed to touch it..."

This did not happen 40 years ago, it happened 2 years ago.

I think Americans are QUITE hung up about sex and the involved plumbing!
