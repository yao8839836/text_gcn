Case Western Reserve Med School teaches nutrition in its own section as
well as covering it in other sections as they apply (i.e. B12
deficiency in neuro as a cause of neuropathy, B12 deficiency in
hematology as a cause of megaloblastic anemia), yet I sill
hold the viewpoint of mainstream medicine:  candida can cause
mucocutaneous candidiasis, and, in already very sick patients
with damaged immune systems like AIDS and cancer patients,
systemic candida infection.  I think "The Yeast Connection" is
a bunch of hooey.  What does this have to do with how well
nutrition is taught, anyway?

Well, maybe I'm getting picky, but I always thought that a yeast
was one form that a fungus could exist in, the other being the
mold form.  Many fungi can occur as either yeasts or molds, 
depending on environment.  Candida exibits what is known as
reverse dimorphism - it exists as a mold in the tissues
but exists as a yeast in the environment.  Should we maybe
call it a mold infection?  a fungus infection?  Maybe we
should say it is caused by a mold-like fungus.

You're the chairman of Biochem and Micro and you didn't know 
that a yeast is a form of a fungus?  (shudder)
Or maybe you did know, and were oversimplifying?
