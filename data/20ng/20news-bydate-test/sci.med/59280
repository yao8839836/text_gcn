No wonder he became confused!  With so many drugs, it is almost impossible
to know which one is causing the problem.  And because some drugs 
potentiate the effect of each other, they can make the side effects
all the worse, and even dangerous.  (kinda like mixing alcohol and 
antihistamines!)

Unfortunately, doctors prescribe drugs to treat the side effects of
the drugs a patient is receiving.  If one drug they are taking causes
the patient's blood pressure to go up, many times an antihypertensive
is prescribed instead of re-evaluating the need for the original drug.
This is why many older adults are trying to take a dozen or so drugs
at home!!!!

I fully agree.  In addition, she proably should be examined by another
doctor who can re-evaluate the need for the medications she is taking.
I can't remember the guidelines I either saw in a text or heard during
a lecture, but any elderly adult who is receiving medications should have
the need for the drug re-evaluated regularly.  If her current physician
is unwilling to do this, find one who will.  Either check the phone 
book for a physician who specializes in geriatric medicine or gerontology, 
or contact a physician referral line or the American Medical Society.
By finding a geriatric specialist, he (she) will more likely be in tune
with the special needs of elderly adults and maybe can help.
