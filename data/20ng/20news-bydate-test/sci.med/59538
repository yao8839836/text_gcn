As a matter of fact, I just saw a dermatologist the other day, and while I 
was there, I asked him about dry skin. I'd been spending a small fortune
on various creams, lotions, and other dry skin treatments.
He said all I needed was a large jar of vaseline. Soak in a lukewarm tub
of water for 10 minutes (ONLY 10 minutes!) then massage in the vaseline,
to trap the moisture in. That will help. I haven't tried it yet, but you
can bet I will. The hard part will be finding the time to rub in the
vaseline properly. If it's not done right, you remain greasy and stick
to your clothes.
Try it. It's got to be cheaper then spending $30 for 8 oz. of 'natural'
lotion.
