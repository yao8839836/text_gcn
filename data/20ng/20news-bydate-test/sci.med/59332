Yogurt contains Lactobacillus acidophilus and L. bulgaricus.  L. 
acidophilus is the major bacteria in the vaginal tract and is primarily 
responsible for keeping the vaginal tract acidic and yeast free.  Most of 
the commercial yogurt sold in the U.S. has a very low L. acidophilus and L. 
bulgaricus count.  Neither of these bacteria are obligate anaerobes with are 
much more important in dealing with the diarrhea problem.  Gordon R. has told 
me through e-mail that he gives his patients L. acidophilus and several 
different obligate anaerobes(which set-up shop in the colon) but he hasn't 
told me which ones yet.  The Lactobacillus genera are mostly facultative 
anaerobes and will set-up shop where they have access to oxygen if given a 
chance(mouth, anus, sinus cavity and vagina).  Having these good bacteria 
around will greatly decrease the chance of candida blooms in the anal 
region or the vagina.  I have not proposed a systemic action for candida 
blooms.  I know that others swear that all kinds of symptoms arise from 
the evil yeast blooms in the body.  I'm not ready to buy that yet.  I do 
believe that complications at specific sites(vagina, anal and maybe lower 
colon, sinus and mouth) can result from antibiotic use which removes the 
competing bacteria from these sites and thus lets candida grow unchecked.
Restoring the right bacterial balance is the best way(in my opinion) to get 
rid of the problem.  Anti-fungals, a low carbohydrate diet and vitamin A 
supplementation may all help to minimize the local irritation until the 
good bacteria can take over control of the food supply again and lower the 
pH to basically starve the candida out.
