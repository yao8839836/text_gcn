Just a quick comment.  As a baptist clergyperson, I find the idea
of such a "baptism" (if the news report is in fact accurate, and
they seldom are regarding religion) offensive.  The pastor here seems
to have a most unbaptist view of baptism- one that seems to demand the
ceremony even when comprehension and choice are absent.

We do baptize converts, but no one who has been deceived into hearing
the word is likely to be a convert.  If in fact the grace of God might
work in such a situation, there is no harm done in waiting a day or
two.

Baptist believe in regenerate membership.  Did this church include these
half-baked (at best) converts into their church fellowship? Or do they
somehow feel there is some validity in dunking them and turning them loose?

This kind of "evangelism" is certainly not baptist, and probably not
very christian, either.
