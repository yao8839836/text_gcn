My first and most important point is that regardless of how your recovery
happened, I'm glad it did!

NOW!  The point that I'll try to make is that coincidences like this occur
with a very high frequency.  How many of us have been thinking of someone
and had that person call?  Much of the whole psychic phenomenon is easily
explicable by this - one forgets the misses.  Consider your astrological
forcast in the newspaper.  How many times have you said "That's me" vs
"That's not me"?  You'll remember the hits, but the misses will be much more
frequent.

And what if, instead if being healed, your affliction got much worse and
you ended up paralyzed?  Would you have attributed that to god as well?
Or would that have been the work of satan?  If you believe that would have
been so, why ONLY good from god, and ONLY evil from satan?  Couldn't the
agony have come from god?  Think about what he did to poor Job!
