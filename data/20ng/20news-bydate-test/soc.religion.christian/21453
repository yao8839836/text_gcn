I agree.   People should not be misled to believe "thus sayeth the Lord" by
innuendo or opinion or speculation.

Speak directly.  If the Lord has given you something to say, say it.
But, before I declare "thus sayeth the Lord", I'd better know for certain
without a shadow of a doubt that I am in the correct spiritual condition
and relationship with the Lord to receive such a prophecy and be absolutely
certain, again, without the tiniest shadow of a doubt that there is no
possibility of my being misled by my own imaginations or by my hope of gaining
recognition or of being misled by the wiles of the devil and his followers.

Mistakes in this area are costly and dangerous.  For me, my greatest fears
in this area would be the following:

1--that the people would be misled
2--that people would lose respect for christianity
3--that true prophecy would be clouded by all the false prophecies
4--were God to call me to be a prophet and I were to misrepresent God's Word,
   my calling would be lost forever.  God's Word would command the people
   never to listen to or fear my words as I would be a false prophet.  My
   bridges would be burnt forever.  Perhaps I could repent and be saved, but
   I could never again be a prophet of God.

In the light of this, it is critical that we speak when the Lord says speak
and that we be silent when the Lord says to be silent lest we deprive the
world of God's Word and hide it under a bushel either by our inappropriate,
cowardly silence or by our false statements.  And because of this, it
is critically important that we remain close to the Lord, in His Word, and
in prayer, and filled with the Spirit of God so that we know the difference.

In this day and age, sinners spout off their mouths left and right judging
one another, claiming "rights" that are not theirs, denying rights that do
indeed belong to others, demanding equal respect for all the "gods" of this
world, and uttering every form of falseness that promises to make one feel
good.

It's time that we christians give an example of honesty that stands out in
contrast against this backdrop of falsehood.  When we say, "thus sayeth the
Lord", it happens.  When we pray, prayer is answered because we prayed right.
When we say we're christians, we really mean it.
