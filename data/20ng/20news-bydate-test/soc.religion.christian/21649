Though you can certaily assert all this, I don't see why it necessarily
has to be the case. Why can't hate just stay as it is, and not beget more?
Who says we have to get disgusted and start hating the sinner. I admit
this happens, but I donlt think you can say it is always necessaily
so.

Why can we not hate with a perfect hatred?

Certainly we should love even our enemies. Amos 5:15 says to hate the evil
and love the good. This can't contradict Christ's teaching. I think we tie
up both hate and love with an emotional attitude, when it really should be
considered more objectively. Surely I don't fly into a rage at every sin
I see, but why can I not "hate" it?
