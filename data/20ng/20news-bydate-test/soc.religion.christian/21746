Does the dismissal in the early church mean that the eucharist was a
secret?  I mean, was it:

	you don't have to stay; from now on, only the membership can
	participate; you really don't have to hang around; yes, I know
	you're obliged to keep up attendance to qualify, but now is an
	exception, okay?

or was it:

	you may not stay; what happens next is secret

When we have had reason to conduct business meetings after church,
we've made it clear that only members can vote.  But we've always been
happy for non-members to stay and observe.

Do you have evidence for intentional secrecy?  (Other than rumours,
which will always happen when you have an underclass doing things not
approved of by those in power?)
