	How do you (Mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage with 
	Christ's statement that in the resurrection people will neither 
	marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?

Footnotes in some bibles reference this verse to the Book of Tobit.
Tobit is in the Septuagint. Goodspeed published it in a book called 
"The Apocrypha". Most any bookstore will have this. At any rate, the Jews 
of Christ's day had this book. It is a story mostly centered around the
son of Tobit who was named Tobias. There was a young lady, Sarah, who had 
entered the bridal chamber with seven brothers in succession. The brothers 
all died in the chamber before consumating the marriage.

Tobias was entitled to have Sarah for his wife (3:17) because Tobias was
her only relative and "...she was destined for [Tobias] from the beginning"
(6:17).

Tobias took her to wife and was able to consumate the marriage. The 
seven husbands would not have her as a partner in heaven. That does not 
eliminate Tobias, her eighth husband. Tobit is a fun and interesting 
story to read. It's kind of a mythical romance. It's a little shorter 
than Esther.

The LDS also have scriptures that parallel and amplify Luke 20. Most 
notably Doctrines and Covenants 132:15-16.

	"Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry 
	her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as
	he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage
	are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of 
	the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they 
	are out of the world.

	"Therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor 
	are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven, which
	angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are 
	worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of 
	glory."

 
Cordially,
