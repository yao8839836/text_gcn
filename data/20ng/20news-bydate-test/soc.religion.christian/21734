I include the key verse (D&C 68:25) because others
may not have the reference.

"And again, inasmuch as parents have children in Zion,
or in any of her stakes which are organized, that teach
them not to understand the doctrine of repentance,
faith in Christ the Son of the living God, and of
baptism and the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying
on of the hands, when eight years old, the sin be
upon the heads of the parents."

What is "the sin" of the parents?

Ezekiel 18 teaches a correct principle.
However, it assumes that fathers and sons have 
equal knowledge to prepare for the judgment.

Parents are responsible to teach their children
the Gospel and other life skills.  Should they
fail to make a sufficient attempt to teach their 
children, the parent would be held responsible
-- not for their children's sins, but for not
teaching them properly.

Whenever the Lord installs someone to a position 
of authority in either the family or the church He
expects that person to teach those in his charge.

In Ezekiel 33:7-9 someone called to care for others 
is likened to "a watchman unto the house of Israel."
"If thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from 
his way, that man shall die in his iniquity; but
his blood will I require at thine hand.
Nevertheless, if thou warn the wicked of his way to 
turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he
shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast
delivered thy soul."

Even though the D&C prefaces this commandment with
"parents have children in Zion" I believe all
parents are responsible for teaching their children 
whatever good principles they understand.
However, LDS parents accept greater responsbility
and could be judged more strictly.
