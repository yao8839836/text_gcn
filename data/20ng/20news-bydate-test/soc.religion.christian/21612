Organization: Indiana University
Lines: 121


   Enclosed is an advertisement for the Defending the Faith IV
conference to be held at Franciscan University of Steubenville (Ohio)
June 25-27.  I attended DTF III last year, and plan to go again this
year.  I would recommend it highly to Catholic interested in
apologetics.  There will be lots of music, well-known Catholic speakers,
fellowship, as well as Eucharistic Liturgies Friday and Sunday.

   Registration is $85 per person, but I believe financial aid is
available if you need it.  Housing in residence halls (each of which has
its own Blessed Sacrament chapel), if desired, is $30/person for double
occupancy for two nights ($30 total). Reservations can also be made for
you at the very nearby Holiday Inn.  I think it was $47 a night there
for my single room.  Meals are available at the cafeteria (Friday dinner
through Sunday lunch) for $38 or $32, with or without breakfast,
respectively.

   Franciscan University of Steubenville is located in eastern Ohio on
US Route 22, 1/2 mile west of the Ohio River and Ohio Route 7.  Greater
Pittsburgh International Airport is less than one hour (35 miles) from
campus.

   Feel free to e-mail me if you have any question I can answer.

   Here is the agenda, as typed in by a friend of mine:

Friday afternoon special:

Reflections on C.S. Lewis, a preliminary session with Walter Hooper.
Walter Hooper is one of the foremost international experts on the
writings of C.S. Lewis.  In 1963, he served as secretary to C.S. Lewis,
and he has since edited 18 of Lewis' literary works for publication.
Walter was ordained a priest in the Church of England in 1965, serving
in Oxford, England, until he entered the Catholic Church in 1988.

   Here is the ad that appeared in _The Catholic Answer_:

                DEFENDING THE FAITH IV CONFERENCE

                    CATHOLIC CHURCH TEACHING:

              KNOW WHY YOU BELIEVE  June 25-27, 1993

   Times have changed.  Major Catholic doctrines are misunderstood and
attacked.  Like never before, believers need to know the reasons behind
the Catholic Church's teaching.  As our first pope urged: "Always be
ready to give a defense for the hope that is within you" (I Peter 3:15).

   Grab your notebooks and get ready for an unforgettable spiritual and
intellectual weekend.  This year's conference will candidly confront the
hardest questions and objections about the Catholic faith.  Deepen your
understanding of Church teaching with _Scott_ and _Kimberly Hahn, Dr.
Thomas Howard, Karl Keating, Dr. Alice von Hildebrand, Dr. Peter
Kreeft,_ and _Fr. Ray Ryland_.

   Cut throught the confusion and doubt, and be better equipped to give
a defense for the hope that is within you.

   Join us at _Defending the Faith IV_, the fourth in a series of annual
conferences designed to strengthen the life of Catholics and others
interested in the Catholic faith.  It can help _you_ know why you
believe.
