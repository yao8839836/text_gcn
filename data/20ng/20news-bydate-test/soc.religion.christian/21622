My sentiments exactly... which is why I'm unsubbing from this group.
This is the 3rd 'christian' discussion list I have ever belonged to
and once again I'm being chased away by the strife, anger, discontent,
lies, et al .

As Paul (Saul) said, 'I come to preach Christ, and Him crucified'
Don't let the simple beauty of faith in God get overshadowed by heady
theological discussions or thousands of lines of post-incarnation
trappings of some church.


As for the atheists/agnostics who read this list: if you aren't
christian and if you have no intention of ever becoming one why on
earth do you waste your time and mine by participating on a christian
discussion list ?

I will continue to search for christian discussion (prayerful, spirit-filled,
kind, humble, patient, etc.) in other circles.

[I'm afraid that any discussion group containing people with different
views tends to turn into arguments about the largest differences
present.  So talk.religion.misc spends a lot of time on
Christian/atheist arguments, soc.religion.christian spends a lot of
time on arguments among different christian groups, and the bitnet
Catholic group spends a lot of time on arguments between conservative
and liberal Catholics.  Personally I would prefer to have a set of
somewhat more specialized groups, at least as an alternative.  Liberal
and conservative Protestant and Catholic would handle most of the
traffic, though there are certainly significant groups (e.g.
Orthodox).  Of course it may be that most of our readers like the
arguments.  I certainly find it painful moderating them.  --clh]
