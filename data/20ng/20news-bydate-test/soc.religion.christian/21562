The point is not about being "nice."  "Nice" is not a christian virtue.  The
point is that the gifts and fruits of the spirit (by their fruits you shall
know them- Mt 7:20) are manifested by and among prayerful, spirit-filled
GAY christians.  It was the manifestation of the spirit among the gentiles
that convinced Peter (Acts 10) that his prejudice against them (based on
scripture, I might add) was not in accordance with God's intentions.

: don't hate the people.  I don't.  I don't hate my kids when they do

Of course the whole issue is one of discernment.  It may be that Satan
is trying to convince us that we know more than God.  Or it may be that
God is trying (as God did with Peter) to teach us something we don't
know- that "God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears
him and does what is right is acceptable to him." (Acts 10:34-35).
