Some years ago -- possibly as many as five -- there was a discussion on
numerology.  (That's where you assign numeric values to letters and then add
up the letters in words, in an effort to prove something or another.  I can
never make any sense of how it's supposed to work or what it's supposed to
prove.)

Somebody posted a long article about numerology in the Bible, saying
things like "this proves the intricate planning of the Scriptures, else
these patterns would not appear".

Then there was a brilliant followup, which was about numerology in all the
other numerology posts.  Stuff like "The word `numerology' adds up to 28,
and the word appears 28 times in the posting!  Such elegant planning!
Further, the word `truth' ALSO adds up to 28; the writer is using these
numerological clues to show us that we reach truth via numerology!"
(These examples are made up by me just as examples.)

I really liked that reply, because it did such an excellent job of showing
that these patterns can be found in just about anything.  However, I did
not save a copy of it.  I do not remember the author.  I'm only 90% sure
that it was posted to this newsgroup.

BUT, on the off chance that somebody remembers it and saved it, or that the
author is reading here, I wanted to know if anyone could send me a copy.  (I
think it should be made into an FAQ, if we can find it.)
