My wifes uncle was a 30+ level mason.  He let me look at some of the books
(which after his death his "brothers" came over and took from his greiving
widow before his body had even cooled).  Don't tell me you don't worship
Osiris.  You must not be past your 20th level.  You should read Wilkinson's
Egyptians and how he shows this Egyptian religion paralleling his own British
Masonry.  There is a man here at this laboratory who is a 33 degree black
mason.  I've talked with him, though much he likes to hide ("mystery"). 
Special handshakes and all.  When he first started trying to "evangelize" me,
he told me all kinds on special this, and special that.  Here is truely a
"mystery" religion.  THere is the public side with motorcyle mania and
childrens hospitals and then there is the priviate side that only the highest
degree mason every learns of.

I haven't read it, but the literature that is offered by the silver haired
apologist (can't remember his name) on TV, didn't exactly come to this same
conclusion.  

"Khons, the son of the great goddess-mother, seems to have been gernaerally
represented as a full-grown god. The Babylonian divinity was also represented
very frequently in Egupt in the very same wayas in the land of his nativity
-i.e. as a child in his mother's arems.  THis was the way in which Osiris, 'the
son, the husband of his mother,' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this
god, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was none
other than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was
originally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother,
or wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with
these Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had
the god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in
perfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case,
considering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood to
Babylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the
Masonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man. 
He was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babylonian
goddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, 'The God of
Fortification.'  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equally
celebrated as 'the strong chief of the buildings.'  THis strong chief of the
buildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall
characteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as the
son of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by
Plutarch, that 'Osiris was black'......."  Hislop

It was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his
cerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  I mean real leopard skin.   He told
me that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (The reason that he
started telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months
to live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately
repented from 'mysteries' of the lodge!)

Nimr-rod from Nimr, a "leopard," and rada or rad "To subdue."  It is a
universal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia
of the god he serves.  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of
some leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or
should I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the "spotted
cow".

I'll stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the "mystery" religions that all
find their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter,  I do not mean to
be a "cold slap to the face" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that
Masonry doesn't find its origins in Egypt.  Of the Masons I have personally
talked to, all refered to Egypt as their origin.  Why are you now separating
yourself from this which not many years ago, was freely admitted?
