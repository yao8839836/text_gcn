Ever since I was a kid and learned to tell when I was in a 
dream I have used my dreams for fantasies or working out problems.
In my dreams I have done everything from yell at my mom
to machine-gunning zombies, not to mention myriad sexual
fantasies. I have deliberately done things that I would never
do in real life. I understand the need to control ones
thoughts, but I always felt that dreams were format free,
no morals, no ethics, no physical laws, (though sometimes I would 
have to wake myself up to go to the bathroom.)

Is this an incorrect attitude? Rather than weakening my inhibitions,
I could argue that I got certain things "out of my system" by 
experiencing them in dreams. By analyzing a dream I can determine
if I have a problem with a certain situation, i.e. in a dream
something will be exagerated that I can then contemplate and
see if it really bothers me or not.

I can't believe that other people don't do the same. It seems 
silly to attach moral significance to dreams.

I think that this is entirely different from out of body
experiences, which I have never had.

Contradictions welcome.
