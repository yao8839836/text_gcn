That is an assumption on your part.  Where is your proof that one always will
degenerate into hating the sinner, because he hates the sin.

I am reminded of the Civil Rights movement in America.  It is true that many
individuals hated the proponents of racism.  It is also true that many 
individuals hated segregation and discrimination with their whole heart and
never degenerated into hating the individuals who practiced it.  Dr. King's
message was this.  Love the individual, the loving of the individual would
transform him into a friend.  However, this did not take away his hatred for
segregation.  His hatred for injustice.

I would ask, "Did John the Baptist practice love when he criticized the Jewish
Leaders of his day?"  Did Jesus Practice love when he threw the moneychangers
out of the temple?

We must have at least a distase for sin.  We must in order to fight it in 
ourselves.  Also we must be ready for the call from God to call sin by its
right name.  Jesus loved everyone, but he called sin by its right name.

It is true that love for others is to guide every step of our walk, but it is
also true that sometimes the love for God calls us to stand up for truth.
