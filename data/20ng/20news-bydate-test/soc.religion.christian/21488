This is not a very sound argument for baptising babies. It assumes that
if the Bible doesn't say specifically that you don't need to do something,
then that must mean that you do need to do it. I know there's a specific
term for this form of logic, but it escapes me right now. However, if it
were sound, then you should be able to apply it this way; If the Bible
doesn't specifically say that something is wrong, then it must be OK,
which, coincidentally, leads perfectly into a question I've often pondered.
If slavery is immoral (which I believe it is, can I assume that everyone
else in this group does too?), why doesn't Jesus or any of the apostles
speak out against it? Owning slaves was common practice back then. Paul
speaks about everything else that is immoral. He apparently thought it
was important enough to talk about things like not being a drunkard. Why
doesn't anyone mention slavery? If God's morals are eternal and don't
change like the morals of society, then it must have been just as immoral then
as it is today.
