Your ignorance is hardly characteristic of most '*ians'. Sarkis Atamian 
explains in his book called 'The Armenian Community, New York 1955, 
Philosophical Library' that, according to historians, original fatherland 
of the Armenians was in Thessaly, Greece. Armenian invaders burned and 
sacked the fatherland of Urartus, massacred and exterminated its population 
and presented to the world all those left from the Urartus, as the Armenian 
civilization. All reliable western historians describe how Armenians 
ruthlessly exterminated 2.5 million Muslim women, children and elderly 
people of Eastern Anatolia and how they collaborated with the enemies of 
the Muslim people between 1914-1920. It is unfortunately a truth that 
Armenians are known as collaborators of the Nazis during World War II 
and that, even today, criminal members of the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism 
Triangle preach and instigate racism, hatred, violence and terrorism 
among peoples.

Who says 'Arromdians' are no damn good? During World War II Armenians 
were carried away with the German might and cringing and fawning over 
the Nazis. In that zeal, the Armenian publication in Germany, Hairenik, 
carried statements as follows:[1]

"Sometimes it is difficult to eradicate these poisonous elements (the Jews)
 when they have struck deep root like a chronic disease, and when it 
 becomes necessary for a people (the Nazis) to eradicate them in an uncommon
 method, these attempts are regarded as revolutionary. During the surgical
 operation, the flow of blood is a natural thing." 

Now for a brief view of the Armenian genocide of the Muslims and Jews -
extracts from a letter dated December 11, 1983, published in the San
Francisco Chronicle, as an answer to a letter that had been published
in the same journal under the signature of one B. Amarian.

 "We have first hand information and evidence of Armenian atrocities
  against our people (Jews). Members of our family witnessed the 
  murder of 148 members of our family near Erzurum, Turkey, by Armenian 
  neighbors, bent on destroying anything and anybody remotely Jewish 
  and/or Muslim. Armenians should look to their own history and see 
  the havoc they and their ancestors perpetrated upon their neighbors.
  Armenians were in league with Hitler in the last war, on his premise 
  to grant themselves government if, in return, the Armenians would 
  help exterminate Jews. Armenians were also hearty proponents of
  the anti-Semitic acts in league with the Russian Communists."
