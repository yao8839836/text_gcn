Try coming up with your own definition of any or all "self-hating" peoples.
To me, any who reject their culture to the point where they *only* see the
absolute negatives of that culture (generally, or regarding a particular
event) and accept *only* those views purely opposing aspects of that culture 
(thus, selective belief in and use of historical facts and a complete ignoring
of "context" results) "hate" their culture. That certainly describes Elias, 
since he has no intention of recognizing that, alongside the Palestinian
experience and perspective, there exists also that of Israelis.

And, this is precisely why Israeli society has been tremendously harmed
by the actions it (its government) has *felt it had to take* in response
to an "other" perceived as a threat. Just as with you, there has long 
been a strident and emotional debate about the pain Israelis feel when 
forced to "balance" desires for survival and moral beliefs. The trauma
of having to make that choice is made worse by the fact that neither
can be conveniently brushed aside (as a result of a reasoned political
debate) for the sake of the other, only reshaped.
