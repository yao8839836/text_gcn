They certainly never CALLED themselves "Palestinians"

Coming from a soldier that can't surprise you.  Eitan is now in
charge of Tsomet, and there's a reason why he only gets a few votes
every year:  They only elect him because he is squeaky clean, no 
corruption.

I'm ignorant.  What's New Statesman?

Oh, those Crafty Jews again!  When will you learn, anti-Semite from

Let's face it, in 1967, what other view was there?

The penniless could mean anyone, big guy.  Grow up.  I hate
your brackets.

They gave them advance warning.  Not like the PLO, eh?

Yeah, yeah.  More brackets.  Am I too picky?

Bracket man.

That was the truth.  Were you there, Elias?

Lehi always warned in advance.  Not the PLO, buddy boy.

It was true!  Why should Jews be unemployed?  We say that in

You don't understand metaphor, Naziman.
And your quotes lead nowhere.  Not only do I doubt there actuality,
but I guarantee they were compiled by some neo-Nazi group.

But I love your pseudo-intellectual approach.  It makes you
sound even dumber than your conclusions.

Echad medinot leshtai amim.
