Can anyone figure out what kind of deranged parent was stupid enough to
bring their infant on a rock throwing crusade (or jihad, sorry)?  18-month
old infants certainly don't walk around the streets on their own.  That would
lead me to believe that some nimrod of a "parent" brought them along for a 
little terrorism.

Uhm, last I heard, the territories were disputed.  Israel's occupation is not
illegal.  They are legally allowed to remain there until a settlement is reached
with the arabs which, from the behavior of the Palestinian negotitating team,
will probably be never.
