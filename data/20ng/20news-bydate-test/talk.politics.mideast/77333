If you were to substitute the word "Jew"/"Jewish" in this posting where you  
see the word "Muslim"/"Islamic", switch Joachim and Mohammed's names around,  
and then repost this, you would get a flood of messages attacking the author  
as an anti-semite. And rightly so. The author of this crap is a racist, pure  
and simple. He obviously has no qualms about being open with it, either,  
unlike some other Arab- and Mulsim-bashers on the Net. 

Now, I for one, am not going to look at Joachim's posting and infer from it  
that all Jews think this way. Sure, there might be some, but this view is not  
a part of Judaism, and it is stupid to believe that all Jews' minds are this  
twisted. However, some Muslims might look at Joachim's flame as a  
reaffirmation of their worst fears about Jews: that they all hate Arabs and  
are racists.

For this reason, I am alarmed that not more Jews on the Net have spoken out  
against what Joachim has said. They have the chance to possibly change the  
anti-semitic views of some people on the net, to show them that all Jews do  
*not* hate all Arabs and Muslims, just like all Muslims do *not* hate all  
Jews. Yet they are missing that chance. Remember, to many people, silence  
implies consent.

Peace.
