I expect better from you, 'Mau'. No, I take that back, I don't. The 
treaty on the exchange of the Turkish and Greek minorities (1923) left 
no Greek minority in Turkiye, except a few thousand Greeks in istanbul. 
Turkiye is no longer an obstacle for 'Pan-Hellenism.' Although the material 
basis of Greek policy is no longer visible, there is a residue, which 
seems to unite the Pelopenisians, the Greeks who came from Asia Minor, 
the Greeks who are originally from the islands of the Marmara Sea
or those who live in the numerous Aegean islands. This residue is 
also recognizable in the contemporary Greek government.

Not a chance. Greece lost in each and every war conducted "solely" 
between Greece and Turkiye: in the Morea in 1821, in Thessaly in 
1897-98, and in Anatolia in 1922. After the Ottoman Empire lost 
World War I, the British landed in 1919 a 200,000 Greek army in 
Izmir to exterminate the people of Turkiye. Are you suffering 
from a severe case of amnesia? The tired and defeated Turks rose up,
formed a National Force under the leadership of Mustafa Kemal, and
on August 30, 1922 they annihilated the bulk of the Greek Army.

I love people who don't read and then spout myths as evidence. Where
were Greeks in 1912 and 1913? I guess, they were busy with...

  Greek Efforts to Decimate the Jewish Population of Salonica
             Culminated in 1912 and 1913

  <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled
  particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially
  as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the
  total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks
  led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to
  the great port of Izmir.

  Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual
  murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek
  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912
  and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,
  when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>

  <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow
  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to
  practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923
  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new
  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a
  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where
  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This
  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting
  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also
  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica
  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By
  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a
  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting
  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the
  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.

  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for
  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.
  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received
  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by
  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in
  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained
  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the
  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during
  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements
  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among
  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim
  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the
  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly
  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as
  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and
  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more
  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-
  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,
  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the
  Empire.>>
