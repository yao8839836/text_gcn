Israeli nationalism (also known as Zionism) is the nationalism of the
Jewish people.  The Jewish people are not a new phenomenon at all.

Palestinean nationalism is the nationalism of Arab people.  Arabs have
been around for a long time.  They already  have some 2 dozen states,
large and small, covering 98% of the Middle East.

More specifically, Palestinean nationalism is the nationalism of Arabs
from the region of Palestine, just as Egyptian nationalism is the
nationalism of Arabs from the region of Egypt.  One Palestinean state
already exists in what was once known as Palestine: - it is called
Jordan. 

There is no justification in carving out a second and tiny Palestinean
state out of the only Jewish state, itself very, very small, just as
there is no justification in carving out another American state out of
Mexico.
