You're just beginning to scratch the surface.  Do you know how much
military equipment costs?  When was the last time you tried to buy a
mil-spec hammer, coffee-pot or toilet seat?  

Paying Israel to do the dirty work on it's own without putting
American soldiers's lives on the line is much, much, much cheaper than
Uncle Sam's arrangements with much of the rest of the world.
