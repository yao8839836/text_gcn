	A few things about the University. It is more fun than some may
admit. Partying does go on and it has consistently been ranked
one of Playboy's top party schools. But we do study and more
importantly learn a lot. The overall UVa drug use is actually
lower than the average college in the U.S. 
	There is no hate law on the books even though they (The
forces of PC) tried to have one last year( by the way a similar
law at the University of Wisconsin ? was found unconstitutional
last year). There is a law
against relationship of professors with their students or
advisees that just passed. 
	Thomas Jefferson was the sole author of the Virginia
statute for religious freedom(the basis for the first ten
amendments), though he is not given full credit for righting
the bill of rights. So someone who picked on me for that is
right. 
	By the way, we're the man in everything. Sports
academics and partying. I'm sure a lot of other schools are
good at what they do as well, so don't start mailing me junk.
I'm happy where I am and maybe I'll go to one of y'alls medical
schools in a couple of years.
