Well everybody,

After reading tons of notes by Serdar, I have come to the following conclusion.   
Turkey is PERFECT, and no Turk has ever made a mistake.  He has proved to me at  
least that the land occupied by Turkey today, was ALWAYS lived in peacefully by  
Turks.  (Including Istanbul AKA Constantinople)  They treat their minorities  
like gods and have only done good while all of their evil neighbors attacked  
them.  Somehow, despite these evil neighbors capable of nothing but murder  
their population has exploded to almost 60 million in Turkey alone. (Note,  
Armenian worldwide population is approximately 7 million total)  I want to go  
to this heaven on earth and meet the race that has made Serdar possible, that  
has persevered, and has become a mecca for human rights lovers.  (Amnesty  
International must have bad sources, Turkey would never torture its citizens,  
treat minorities badly, or kidnap 7 foreign journalists last year alone, who  
incidentally are still missing), what I am trying to say is I WANT TO BE A  
TURK!!!!

Now back to reality.  I have once again been astounded by Serdars ability to  
ignore all truth, all truly difficult questions, and go on to his encyclopedia  
of quotes and sources that can be pasted into any note BY THE PAGE!  Anybody at  
all who has believed ANYTHING he has said, please step forward.  Let him know  
he hasn't been wasting his time, that SOMEBODY out there can be convinced by  
the volume of e-mail you can produce, not the quality of the content. Well I am  
off now.  I will go dream  some more about that perfect place, that nirvana,  
that utopia, that xanadu, that TURKEY!
