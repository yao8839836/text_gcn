So, Mr. Salah is still claiming Stalin was a Jew? 

This thread began on SCA, when he and another guy claimed both Stalin
and Lenin were Jews. When I posted evidence from books and the Britannica
showing they were Christians, someone made the (correct) remark that
Lenin's maternal grandfather was a Jew who converted to Christianity.

To counter the fact that Stalin was a Christian who, during his youth,
was trained to be a priest, Mr. Salah wrote "yes, it says he was trained
to be a priest, but not for what religion!" (BTW, Stalin developed
strong antisemitic feelings later in his life).

Mr. Salah seems intent on trying to spread hate against Jews by posting
antisemitic forgeries and trying to "prove" that certain notorious
people were Jews, even if they were not.
