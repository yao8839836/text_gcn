Thanks for posting the references. I do not normally read t.p.m.,
and I posted my request for references because Jim's article
was cross-posted to soc.culture.jewish. Allegations of Jewish
disrespect for the objects and buildings of other religions are
one of antisemitic stereotypes that permeate western culture, and
rumors of church and Host desacration probably caused more pogroms
than blood libel. The stereotypes that pervade our culture create
cognitive illusions that reify those stereotypes. Therefore any
claim that appears to reify a stereotype should be treated by
decent people with utmost suspicion until and unless documented.
If such a claim is cross-posted to a news group in which it has
not been documented before, such as s.c.j, a reference should be
given the first time it appears.  Now that the claim has been
documented, I regard the whole episode as disgusting and
shameful. Especially so because the official who failed to
provide proper temporary facilities for the evicted Jordanians
was probably Jewish, and as a Jew I know that he should have
known better.
