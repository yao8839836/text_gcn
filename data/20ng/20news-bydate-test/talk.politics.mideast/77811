THE NEW VICE-PREMIER PLANS TO INTENSIFY THE WORK ON THE ATTRACTION OF
WESTERN INVESTMENTS

  BAKU (MAY 19) TURAN: Yesterday, Rasul Guliyev, the recently appointed
Vice-Premier of the republic, received the US ambassador in Azerbaijan,
Richard Miles. As "Azerbaijan" newspaper informs, the issue of attraction
of western investments in Azerbaijan was discussed in the meeting. In
particular, Gulyiev stated that western capital has to be investigated in
the most profitable spheres of manufacture. He also noticed, that the number
of the priority manufactures will be released from debts. 
Guliyev also said that intensifying the activities of the American oil 
companies will promote the strengthening of the American-Azeri relations.


THE PROPOSAL TO SUMMON SPECIAL SESSION OF THE SUPREME SOVIET IS REJECTED AGAIN

   Baku (May 19) Turan: Yesterday, in the sitting of the Milli Mejlis,
the chairman, Isa Gambar, rejected the proposal of the deputy Arif
Rahimzade to summon a special session of the Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan.
  This written proposal to summon a session was signed by 130 deputates. But
the chairman said that the signatures were invalid and the proposal couldn't
be submitted for discussion.
   Earlier, the leadership of the Milli Mejlis called the proposal to summon
a special session of the Supreme Soviet a coup attempt. But the deputy for
the Parliament, Rahimzade, doesn't consider that the deputates have the 
objective of removing Milli Mejlis and its chairman from the power. It concerns the
serious analysis of the social, economic and foreign policy activity of the
republic's authority. Rahimzade said that the deputates for the Parliament,
ejected from their duties one year ago have the rights to express their opinion
on these questions.
   The Supreme Soviet of Azerbaijan (340 deputates) was dissolved one year ago,
when it attempted to bring Ayaz Mutalibov back to the power.
   The functions of S.S. were handed over to Milli Mejlis, consisting of 50
deputates (25 "democrats" and 25 "partocrates"). At that time "democrats" and
"partocrates" came to an agreement that Milli Mejlis wouldn't exist for a long 
time and would be dissolved after parliamentary elections. At the same time,
the deputates ejected from their duties were guaranteed that they could summon
a session of the Supreme Soviet any time and went in for political activity out
of the Parliament. --0--


THE PROSPECTS OF TRADE/ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN AZERBAIJAN AND ESTONIA

    Baku (May 19) Turan: The prospects of signing trade-economic agreement
between Azerbaijan and Estonia were discussed in the meeting of the Foreign 
Minister Tofig Gasimov with the group of experts of the Ministry of Economics,
Minister of Foreign Affairs and Estonian Bank administration on May 18. 
The group of experts is headed by Tikht Reiman, the chief of the Ministry of
Economics of Estonia.
   The MIA of Azerbaijan informed Turan agency, that in their stay in Baku,
the delegation will also visit Ministry of Economics and National Bank of the
republic.--0--


AZERBAIJAN DOES NOT INTEND TO JOIN THE CIS COMMON ECONOMIC ZONE

   Baku (May 19) Turan: Deputy prime-ministers of the republic, Vahid
Ahmedov and Abbas Abbasov declared that Azerbaijan wouldn't join the CIS
common economic zone.
   Vahid Ahmedov considers that the CIS economic zone proposal to create a 
common tax system contradicts independent economic policy of the republic. 
According to Abbas Abbasov, the pact of cooperation proposals, submitted for
the discussion of the leaders of CIS states in Moscow on May 14, has a number
of unfavorable points for Azerbaijan.
   Such announcements of two deputy prime-ministers sound sensational on the
background of the fact that the president of Azerbaijan and the chairman of
the Parliament noted the necessity of the republic on joining the CIS economic
zone.--0--


THE QUESTIONS OF GRANTING CREDIT TO AZERBAIJAN WILL BE DISCUSSED IN MOSCOW

     Baku (May 19) Turan: Today, Azerbaijani delegation headed by the director
of the foreign relation department of the Ministry of Finance of the republic
along with the representatives of the National Bank will leave for Moscow to
hold consultation with Russian government on granting credit to Azerbaijan. 
According to the preliminary information, the credit will be 50 billion rubles.
    As press-centre of Ministry of Finance informed Turan's correspondent, 
precise amount of the credit, conditions of its repay and a number of other
questions of mutual interest will be discussed in the course of the meeting in
Moscow. It is known that this credit will be mostly used for mutual settling
of industrial enterprises of Azerbaijan and Russia.
    When the sides reach the agreement, it is proposed for signing by the end 
of May.--0--


AZERBAIJAN WILL REPLY TO THE SECOND VARIANT OF TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BY 26 OF
MAY

     Baku (May 19) Turan: On the measures for peace presented by Russia,
Turkey and the USA to Azerbaijan and Armenia, the representative of the
president of Azerbaijan in the talks on Nagorno-Karabakh, Asim Gasimov noted
that the plan was not seriously changed in comparison with the first variant.
     "Just some comments to several points were added to the schedule by 
insistence of the Armenian side. We do not intend to come back to the analysis
of the schedule, because we have given a positive answer to it on May 6",- said
Gasimov.
     The representative of the president of Azerbaijan informed that they just
began to work on the examination of the commentary, and their answer would be 
given as requested by the authors of trilateral initiative by May 26.
     As it is known, the first variant of the peace measures was rejected by
Armenia, which put forward a number of pre-conditions for its acceptance.--0--


THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE PROSECUTOR OF THE REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

   BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The Azerbaijani prosecutor's office has announced
that the Russian mass media's attempt to portray the 6 Russian soldiers 
condemned by the military board of the Azerbaijani Supreme Court, as innocent
people is unjustified.
    Accounts of the witnesses and the confessions of the condemned themselves,
prove that their crimes were committed together with the Armenian military units
and with the knowledge of the headquarters of the Russian army unit, where they
served.
    The announcement points out that the attempts to represent these soldiers
as ordinary mercenaries who have nothing to do with the Russian army are also 
unfounded. For there are irrefutable evidences that these soldiers were on the
list of one of the military unit's of Russian commandos in Yerevan.
   Certain Russian circles try to conceal the fact of direct participation of
the Russian army in the undeclared war of Armenia against Azerbaijan from the
Russian community. Azerbaijan's prosecutor's announcement follows, that this
type of actions can make the situation in the region much more complicated.--0--


AZERBAIJAN'S PARLIAMENT INTENDS TO APPEAL TO RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT REGARDING THE
SIX ACCUSED SOLDIERS

     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed, parliament of Azerbaijan
is considering the question of appealing to Russian parliament about the six
accused soldiers' fortune. In particular, the offer to send the representatives
of the Commission on military affairs of the armed forces of Russian Federation
to Baku for the detailed study of the results of six Russian soldiers' case will
be directed to Russian parliament.
     According to one of the supporters of this offer, such initiative will give
Russian parliament the possibility to be convinced of the correctness of the
investigation. There will also be a chance to discuss the reasons that have
given rise to the present situation - that is the Russian troops participation
in the war against Azerbaijan.


ARMENIANS ARE PREPARING MORE "KARABAKHS" ON THE NORTH CAUCASUS

     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The National-liberation front founded by group of 
Armenians living on the North Caucasus appealed to establish Armenian autonomies
on the territories of Rostov, Stavropol and Krasnodar regions, - reported the
newspaper "Russky vestnik" on March 9, 1993 published in Geneva.
     The North Caucasus is regarded as an integral part of Armenia in the 
documents of this organization. Admitting the non-realizability of "reunion" of
the North Caucasus and "Armenia proper" at present, the front is appealing to 
the UN, presidents of Russia, Armenia and the United States to consider the
need to establish Armenian autonomies on the Caucasus.
     To attain these goals, the Armenian organization considers it necessary to
carry out on the North Caucasus the forms and methods of activity "identical to
those in Nagorno Karabakh". Besides the decision to fund cells of Armenian
national-liberation fronts in every settlement and to appeal to leaders of
Armenian terrorist groups in Greece and Iran to sent to the North Caucasus 
instructors for training of Armenian youth to wage secret wars was adopted.
     Thus according to the newspaper "Russky vestnik", "new Karabakhs" are 
being planning on the North Caucasus. --O--


STATE ASSISTANCE FOR NATIONAL MINORITY DEVELOPMENT

     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: The meeting headed by the State secretary of
Azerbaijan, Ali Kerimov, with the participation of the national cultural
centers was held in Baku. The first results of the realization of the president
Elchibey's decree on state assistance for the development of language and
culture of national minorities adopted on September 16, 1992 were considered. 
     The State secretary called this decree as an important step to establish a
legal democratic state. He confirmed once more the commitment of the leadership
of Azerbaijan to set up a democratic society in which the rights of all 
nationalities and ethnic groups would be respected.
     The State Counsellor of the president of Azerbaijan on the national policy,
Hidayat Orujev, announced that in spite of the difficulties of the "undeclared
war" against the republic, the leaders of the state managed to solve many 
problems concerning the satisfaction of cultural and other needs of the ethnic
groups. 
     For today, all 33 national-cultural centers registered by the Ministry of
Justice in the capital of Azerbaijan are provided with accommodation, furniture 
and means of communication. All the accommodations are rent-free ( 8 foreign
diplomatic missions in Baku are placed in the hotels because of the absence of
free accommodations including the representation of the UN General secretary). 
     As it was noted, a great work was carried out since the decree was adopted
to create conditions for total development of the ethnic groups. On the North of
Azerbaijan where Lezghins live, a national Lezghin theater was opened, 
radiocast is transmitted in Lezghin. The work over the creation of the
educational literature for Talyshs, Tats, Lezghins and Kurds and national
teaching and scientific staff is being carried out in the Academy of Sciences
of Azerbaijan.--O-- 


MEMORANDUM OF COOPERATION ON EXTRACTING OIL-GAS FIELDS OF AZERBAIJAN WAS SIGNED

     BAKU (MAY 20) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed in the State 
concern "Azerineft", the Memorandum of understanding with the companies
"AMOCO Caspian Sea Petroleum", "Bi-Pi Exploration Operating", "Pennzoil
Caspian", "Unocal Khazar Ltd.", "McDermott" and Turkish oil corporation on
mutual extracting of fields "Azeri", "Chirag" and "Gyuneshli" was signed. 
According to the memorandum, the general group on preparing of a common
program of activity was created. 
     According to the president of "Azerineft", Sabit Bagirov, cooperation
will provide for using the experience of foreign companies more efficiently. 
     During the project, the main principles will be the effective use of
oil-gas resources, the rational sharing of investments, the reducing of
exploitation expenditures and maximizing the profit of Azerbaijan from the
exploitation of these fields. 
The memorandum also envisions the necessity to take into account the historical
and political-economical interests of Azerbaijan under optimum use of oil-gas
fields. --O--


ARMENIA TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE PROSECUTION OF SIX RUSSIAN SOLDIERS

     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: After Azerbaijani court passed sentence on 
six Russian soldiers fighting on the Armenian side in Karabakh,
Armenian propaganda has become actively involved.
     The Armenians living in Russia appealed to the president Yeltsin
with a request "to display firmness in asserting the rights of Russian
soldiers". At the same time, Armenian mass media call legal proceedings
on the case in Baku as "a farce aimed at getting more arms from Russia".
     The Karabakh Armenians have issued a threat recently. If one could
believe the Yerevan agency "Snark", the Armenians in Karabakh presented
an ultimatum to authorities in Azerbaijan. The essence of this ultimatum
is that if Russian soldiers are not shown mercy, three Azeri prisoners in
Karabakh will be shot dead.
     It is simple to explain such "touching attitude of Armenians" to
the six Russian soldiers' fate. If by chance the sentence is executed
it will cause not anti-Azeri but anti-Armenian reaction, as the accused
Russian soldiers were recruited in Yerevan by the former Defence Minister
of Armenia and then transferred to Karabakh.
     If the soldiers get mercy, Armenian side will think highly of its
saving of lives of "innocent Russians". --O--


NEW PROVOCATIONS OF ARMED FORCES OF ARMENIA

     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: According to the Defence Ministry of
Azerbaijan on May 20-21, the firing on the territories of Azerbaijan
from the military bases on the territory of Armenia was in progress.
     The day before, the villages of Kolly-Gyshlag, Shotaraz,
Nyachaflar of Zangelan district of Azerbaijan were under fire from
Kafan district of Armenia. Two inhabitants were wounded, there were
destructions in the villages.
     On May 20, the firing on the villages of Bashkend, Mutudere,
Shynykh, Novosaratovka and Novoivanovka of Kedabek district of
Azerbaijan from the positions of Armenian armed forces was in
progress.
     At the same day the diversion group of the armed forces of
Armenia (50-60 men) violated the frontier of Azerbaijan, penetrated
into the territory of Kedabek district of Azerbaijan, killed two
shepherds at the village of Aili-Dara and made an attempt to take a
flock across the frontier. Azeri frontier-guards stopped the enemy.--O--


"UNOCAL" COMPANY WILL BUILD 50 HOUSES FOR REFUGEES IN AZERBAIJAN

     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: As Turan agency was informed by the
representation of UNOCAL American oil company, the leaders of this
company decided to give 750 thousand dollars for the construction of
50 houses for refugees.
     At present, the American side suggested a village project for 
consideration by appropriate departments of Azerbaijan. The project
is a farm village where each house has a personal lot, subsidiary
accommodations and so on.
     According to the program the construction and putting into
operation of the village will be this year. --O--


MANAT IS BEGINNING TO FALL IN VALUE

     BAKU (MAY 21) TURAN: Lately, at the black market of Baku, the
national currency - Manat, fell in price compared with the Russian
Ruble. Thus one gives 1100 Rubles or 120 Manats for one US dollar.
Taking into account the official exchange-value of the Manat with 
respect to Ruble which is 1-10, the national currency fell in value
10 percent. Meanwhile the exchange-value of the Manat to the Ruble is
the same at banks, state establishments and in trade.
     According to the representatives of the business circles and
experts, the present situation is explained by the fact that the rubles
are bought by the local businessmen. They need rubles for financial
operations in Russia. As the remittance of payments from the republics
of the former USSR to Russia is a great problem now, many businessmen
arrange deals in cash. Taking into consideration the volume of business 
with Russia, counted by billions, it is not hard to imagine how much 
Rubles in cash the businessmen need. --O--


THE DISCUSSION OF PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION BILL WILL LAST TILL MID JULY

    Baku (May 22) Turan: According to the president's decree, the
expert group, including representatives of the Parliament and 
presidential apparatus, are working out new wording of the Constitution
of the Republic of Azerbaijan. This must be adopted by Milli Mejlis before
the Parliamentary elections. Together with this, the work on the new
Constitution, that would be, evidently, adopted by new Parliament of
the country, is going on. The newsmen were informed about the work on the
press-conference of the Supreme Soviet of the republic the day before.
    Parliamentary legal experts, Safa Mirzoyev, Simran Hasanov and 
representatives of the department of the president's apparatus Fazil Mustafaev
and Shahin Aliev took part in the press-conference.
    The national discussion of the project of the Parliamentary
election law is going on at present. According to Simran Hasanov the bill
didn't cause any objections. It was noted, that until now, no alternative
variant of the election law was put forward.
   The newsmen were also informed, that Parliamentary commissions
will examine all coming proposals till June 10. By June 15 all
proposals will be generalized and submitted for discussion in Milli Mejlis.--0--


ISA GAMBAR SUGGESTS THAT AZERI-RUSSIAN PARLIAMENT COMMISSION FOR 
CLARIFYING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CRIMINAL CASE BE CREATED

   BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: The Chairman of the Milly Mejlis of the
Azerbaijan republic, Isa Gambar, sent the return letter to the Chairman
of the Russian Supreme Soviet Ruslan Khasbulatov in connection with
the conviction of the Russian servicemen lieutenant V.Semion, sergeant
K. Tukish, M.Lisov and A.Filipov by the military college of the
Supreme Court of Azerbaijan.
   In his letter, Isa Gambar suggested that the commission of Azerbaijan
Milly Mejlis deputates on a par with the experts of the Russian Supreme
Soviet be established to clarify the circumstances of this criminal
case. In his view, "the conclusion of the commission could help in the 
objective solving of this problem, as well as such kind of problems
in the future. But the main thing is, it could help to promote the
knowledge about involvement of the Russian servicemen in crime".
   In its turn, in connection with the Russian parliament message,
Milly Mejlis adopted a resolution on May 19, according to which the
permanent commissions on government building and legal policy, human
rights and international relations are charged with the exploration of
this problem.--0--


WILL THE TRILATERAL INITIATIVE BE RUINED?

      Baku (May 22) Turan: As Turan agency was informed, Russian representative
to the talks on Karabakh, Vladimir Kazimirov, doubted in realization of the 
Trilateral initiative. He expressed this opinion during a telephone talk with
the representatives of Azerbaijan. At the same talk he declared, that in case
the peace process deadlocked, Russia would pursue Yeltsin's initiative itself.
     Such statement from the Russian diplomat, who is one of the authors
of the Trilateral initiative, suggests that the Russian leadership is
paving the way for complete exclusion of the USA and probably Turkey from
the peacemaking process. This statement can also mean, that Russia and
US having achieved understanding on Bosnian problem, have agreed on partial
US departure from Transcaucasia.--0--


FATE OF 645 MILLION TONS OF OIL WILL BE DECIDED THIS SUMMER

   Baku (May 22) Turan: The president of Azerbaijan State Oil Company,
Sabit Bagirov, declared recently that complete treaty on development of
oil fields Chirag, Azeri and Guneshli would be signed this summer.
As it is known, western oil companies AMOCO, BP-STATOIL, PENNZOIL-
RAMCO have an interest on development of these three richest Caspian
fields.
   According to the plan, SOCAR and BP-STATOIL are to sign a complete
treaty on development of Chirag field on June 16. Later AMOCO and
PENNZOIL will sign treaties.
   Specialists value total reserves of these three fields to be 645
million ton. 310 million of them fall on Azeri field, 180 mln.ton
on Geneshli and 150 mln.ton on Chirag.
   The exploitation of these fields is to last tens of years and it is to
bring in Azerbaijan 100 billion dollars in revenue. In addition to the net
economic profit, Baku calculates upon the political support of the West in
the defence of its interests at the international scene.
   As president Elchibey said in his closest encirclement "the May of
1993 will be one of the most difficult periods for Azerbaijan and its
independence and we have to stand these tests".--0--

THE SCIENTIST-LAWYERS OF RUSSIA APPEALED TO THE PRESIDENT OF AZERBAIJAN

   BAKU (MAY 22) TURAN: As the press-service of the president of Azerbaijan
informs, today, the appeal of the Institute of the Government and law of the
Russian Academy of Sciences to president Elchibey was received.
The appeal contains the call "to display mercy, humanism and clemency 
on the death sentences of the former servicemen of the Russian Armed
Forces".
   The authors of the appeal point out, that they don't justify the
participation of the Russian servicemen in the war against the azeri people,
don't call in question the lawfulness of the passed sentence, denounce
the mercenary according to the UN principals, and they are sorry about the
Russian servicemen being drawn in such grave crime.
    At the end of their letter, scientists, mentioning the soldiers'
mothers' tears and grief, their praying day and night of safety, ask the
president of Azerbaijan to "save those guys".
   It should be noticed, that unlike lawyers, soldiers' mothers,
taking part in the inquiry, called the cause of their grief only
Russian policy. According to their words, the leaders, that lay down
lives of Russian men to achieve their political aims, must be made
answerable.
    Unfortunately, the appeal didn't mention the grief of the mothers
of Azerbaijani soldiers, killed by sentenced Russian servicemen.--0--

AZERI PRIME-MINISTER IS LEAVING FOR GREAT BRITAIN

  BAKU ( MAY 22 ) TURAN : The Minister of Foreign Economic Relations,
Rauf Garayev, in his interview to Turan agency said, that
"Great Britain is the biggest foreign economic partner of Azerbaijan
after Iran". The business cooperation between the two countries
develops in such spheres as oil - industry, the manufacture of oil
extraction equipment, communication and agriculture.
  According to the Minister's words, the forthcoming visit of
Azerbaijani Prime-Minister, Panah Huseynov, to Great Britain on May
23-24, is very important. It is expected, that the visit will
help, to solve the problems of opening in Azerbaijan the branch
offices of some British banks, insurance firms; to conclude
contracts on the sphere of manufacture of agricultural equipment; on
building in Azerbaijan off shore oil platforms, and reconstruction of the
entire communication system of Azerbaijan.
   In Garayev's view, the expansion of the cooperation with Great Britain
will have a great political meaning for Azerbaijan.
   According to politicians and reviewers in Baku, at present, Great
Britain as an European state is close to Azerbaijan. The continuation of
the economic and political cooperation of the two states is foreseen. --O--
