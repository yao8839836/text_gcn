village, not one tribe, should be left."
(Joseph Weitz, Jewish National Fund, administrator

8. "[Zionists]...looked for means...to cause the tens of 
thousands of sulky Arabs who remained in the Galilee to 
flee...I gathered all the Jewish muktars, who have contact 
with Arabs in different villages and asked them to 
whisper in the ears of some Arabs that a great Jewish 
reinforcement has arrived in Galilee and that it is going 
to burn all of the villages of the Huleh. They should 
suggest to these Arabs, as their friends, to escape while 
there is still time....The tactic reached its goal....wide 
areas were cleaned."

24. "In the months preceding the Arab invasion [of

independence early in May, on the eve of the invasion 
by the five Arab states."
(Menachem Begin, The Revolt,  Nash, 1972, p.348)

money, Jewish power and Jewish enthusiasm"

(Yitzhak Rabin, Le Monde, 29 February 1968)

27. "To pretend that the Egyptian forces massed on our 
frontiers [in 1967] were in position to threaten the 
existence of Israel constitutes an insult not only to the 
intelligence of anyone capable of analyzing this sort of 
situation, but above all an insult to the Zahal [Israeli 
army]"
(General Res. Matti Peled, Ha'aretz,  19 March 1972)

28. "when we have broken the strength of the Arab 
Legion and bombarded Amman, we would wipe out 
Transjordan; after that Syria would fall....we would thus 
end the war, and would have put paid to Egypt, Assyria 
and Chaldea on behalf of our ancestors"
(David Ben Gurion in his diaries, quoted in Michael Bar-
Zohar,  The Armed Prophet, A Biography of Ben-Gurion, 
Prentice-Hall, 1967, p.139)

29. "These Jews of the Diaspora would like to see us, for 
their own reasons, heroes with our backs to the wall. But 
this wish can in no way change the realities."
(Israeli General Ezer Weizmann, Le Monde, 3 June 1972)

30. "Let us not today fling accusations at the [Palestinian 
Arab] murderers. Who are we that we should argue 
against their hatred ? For eight years now they sit in 
their refugee camps in Gaza, and before their very eyes, 
we turn into our homestead the land and the villages in 
which they and their forefathers have lived. We are a 
generation of settlers, and without the steel helmet and 
the cannon we cannot plant a tree and build a home. Let 
us not shrink back when we see the hatred fermenting 
and filling the lives of hundreds of thousands of Arabs, 
who sit all around us. Let us not avert our gaze, so that 
our hand shall not slip. This is the fate of our generation, 
the choice of our life - to be prepared and armed, strong 
and tough - or otherwise, the sword will slip from our 
first, and our life will be snuffed out."
(Moshe Dayan, eulogy of Roy Rutenberg at Kibbutz Nahal 
Oz, 1956, quoted in Uri Avneri, Israel without Zionists, 
Collier Books, Macmillan, New York, 1971, p.154)
