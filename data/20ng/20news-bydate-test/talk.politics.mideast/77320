And is there a reason or value for such a brainless shit for brains asshole
to be haer.  You are a self hating bastard.  Neither your name nor your
ideas, which I've come across before and thought were too stupid and 
uncivlized to respond to, prove your first-worldist claim and civility.

There is nothing primitive about Islam except in your mind.  I do read and
live daily with disagreable facts, and I only ask them to prove themselves.
The last time I checked, this was truly a 1st-worldist civilized approach to
facts and figures.  I did not whine about  the jews, I merely stated a fact
thet is strange to nobody.  As far as me being jerk, FUCK YOU.  (Sorry to
other people that read this).

I am at home fuck face.  my name does not mean I am from somewhere else,
except in your litte manute stupid brain.   And while we are at names,
yours does not particularly seem to be 1st-worldist.  Ajami?? What's that

really hate yourself don't you ass-hole??
