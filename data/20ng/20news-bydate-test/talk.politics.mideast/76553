Kaufman,
I think we have a problem in this newsgroup: every time somebody puts
down serious questions on Israel, the first response would be "what about
the Arab countries?" ...

Most of the Arab countries governments are ruling their people with Iron
fist policy and Dark Ages democracy (if exists). Ironically, these are 
the countries that the "West" would like to deal with and would wage 
massive wars to protect them and their resources.

For Israel the situation is different, Israel claims it is a
democracy -- I would call it selective democracy, that abides by Western
democratic standards. If Israel is saying that then
it has to be compared to Western standards. If this comparison is the
advertized propaganda from Israel, then we have to look at seriously at
question that can and should be asked regarding any country advertizing
this standard.

That is very incorrect, I see you have been brain-washed well, I would
recommend non-Zionist history books).

Please, speak for yourself. Do not imagine that "everyone" subscribes to
your beliefs, you would be lucky if you believe them yourself.

What is this, you trying to destroy the credibility of the author, why?
all of this because he asked some serious question. These tactics of
destroying the credibility of a person beacuse you do not agree with
her/him is old and does not work anymore, go tell your superiors
(AIPAC?) to change their guide books.
