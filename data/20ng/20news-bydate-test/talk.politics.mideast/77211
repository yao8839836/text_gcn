I think there are some generally accepted criteria according to which
one can evaluate whether certain policies or practices constitute
racial discrimination. These criteria are to be found for example in the
1.  International Convention for Abolition of All Forms of Racial
    Discrimination (ratified by most countries)
2.   The International Covenant of Political and Civil Rights
3.   The Human Rights Charter
4.   The European Convention of Human Rights

If one reads carefully how racial discrimination is defined in these
legally binding instruments, and does not resort to sophistry, it is
obvious that the State of Israel is guilty of racial discrimination.


The people suffering the most extreme form of racial discriminatnion
by the Zionist regime are the Palestinian refugees, some of whom live
under Israeli military control and others who live in the diaspora.

They are not entitled to return to their homeland for the sole
reason that they are not Jews. International law does not include any
provisions which permits such denial of rights, under any circumstance.
Israel's actions of denial are totally illegal and immoral. By allowing
the return of the refugees and permitting them to settle in Tel in any area  of
the State of Israel, the State would finally gain its legitimaty under
international law and could be justified in asking to be recognized. It
would facilitate the peaceful integration of Israel into the Middle-east
and constitute the best guarantee for permanent Jewish presence -
in the area. Any attempt to create a separation, formal and human, between the
Israeli Jewish and Palestinian Arab communities, is fraught with
genociadal implications. I hope that U.S. Jews, who sincerely wish that
peace prevail in Israel/Palestine, will finally realize this fact.

Zionist racial discrimination are described.
