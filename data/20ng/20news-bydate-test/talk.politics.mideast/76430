Tsiel,

I would contend that there was shelling from both sides of the border,
starting from the early 70's.  Certainly the PLO did shell Northern
Israel from the Arqoub region, but Israel did much more shelling
destroying several South Lebanese villages.  At the very least
we can say that both sides exchanged shelling, with occasional
aerial raids by Israel on Lebanese villages.
In any case Steve's characterization that the 1982 invasion was only in 
response to years of shelling from Lebanon is false.  Israel had
many reasons for invading but mainly it did so to install a government
in Lebanon favorable to Israel, and it nearly achieved this aim
with the election of Basheer El Gemayel, and his brother, Amin
El Gemayel, but the internal situation in Lebanon was too hard
to control and predict so Israel had to withdraw, and Amin El Gemayel
had to abrogate the 17 th of May Agreement.
