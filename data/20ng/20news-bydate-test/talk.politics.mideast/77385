I say despite all the bad news for Muslims around the world, things are
shaping up very well, a lot of killings might happen in the near future,
though (as if Bosnia is not a lot).
Right now, I feel like saying what Martillo said : "the stage is set".
I don't think that things will be the same in ten year, 
On the pessimistic/realistic side, we can only see the stage set for more
wars imposed on our people, and governments being remote controlled.
to fight each other and to oppress their own people, but I am confident
they will all fall:
I venture to list the order: Sudan/Yemen alliance, Algeria/Libya in 5 years,
Tunisia one year later but Egypt may face direct colonization very soon to
prevent an Islamic government which might take over after Egypt attacks 
SUdan and is envolved in atrocities there as it fails to achieve
victory.  Meanwhile Saudia faces a civil war and goes to war 
with Yemen/Sudan over it,  The new North African 
Alliance (Algeria/Tun/Libya) goes to war with Morocco who attacks it.
U.S/France involved everywhere but cannot concentrate on one place, 
especially that Syria/Jordan/Iraq have to be kept under control.

After the cloud clears, I do not know what the end result will be,

O.K back to reality:

 	CAIRO, Egypt (UPI) -- The Cairo-based Arab Organization for Human
 Rights (AOHR) Sunday called on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia to order the
 release of members of the kingdom's first human rights group.

.....
>	Among those group wants released was Mohamed Ben Abdullah Al Masaari,
 spokesman of the Committee for the Defense of Legitimate Rights (CDLR).
 Al Masaari was arrested just before dawn Saturday at his residence in
 Riyadh's King Faisal University, where he worked as a physics professor,
>human rights and media sources reported.
 	The media reports said Saudi security forces also seized
 publications, books, correspondence and other documents and papers from
 Al Masaari's residence. He was reportedly taken to an unknown
>destination.
 	The London-based Liberty human rights group claimed that the other
>five members who together with Al Massari formed CDLR on May 3, were
 summoned for police questioning and might have been detained as well.
 	On Thursday, the Saudi government ordered the firing and disbarment
 of the six activists because they established the group urging people in
>the kingdom with grievances to report to CDLR.
>	Four of the activists were sacked from their positions with two
 state-run Saudi universities and two government departments, and two
>lawyers, including Al Masaari's father, were disbarred and their law
>offices were closed, the AOHR said.
