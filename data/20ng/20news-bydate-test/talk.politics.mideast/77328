This does not change the *fact* that "Muslim" is a legal and political
term defined constitutionally in former Yugoslavia, and therefore has
meaning and consequences entirely *independent* and *immaterial* of
any religious considerations.

You only wish it were so.

More than 2,000,000 residents of Croatia and B-H have *not* accepted the
terms of secession which Tudjman and Izetbegovic unilaterally forced upon
them.  Croats and Muslims may have a right to negotiated secession but
they do not have a right to grab the *entire* territories of the former
Yugoslav republics of Croatia and B-H.

Oh, BTW, *Yugoslavia* was *internationally recognized* when it was 
destroyed by Tudjman, Izetbegovic, Milosevic, and the international
community led by Germany.  If Yugoslavia's borders could be changed
against its will, then certainly Croatia's borders and B-H's borders
can be changed as well.  

As I have stated many times: the civil war in ex-Yugoslavia will end
when the terms of secession (borders, etc.) for Croatia and B-H are
finally agreed upon.  Serbs, Croats, and Muslims will *all* have to
make territorial concessions to reach such an agreement.
