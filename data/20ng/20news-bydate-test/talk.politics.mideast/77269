Come again? The image-conscious Armenians sorely feel a missing 
glory in their background. Armenians have never achieved statehood 
and independence, they have always been subservient, and engaged 
in undermining schemes against their rulers. They committed 
genocide against the Muslim populations of Eastern Anatolia 
and x-Soviet Armenia before and during World War I and fully 
participated in the extermination of the European Jewry 
during World War II. Belligerence, genocide, back-stabbing, 
rebelliousness and disloyalty have been the hallmarks of the 
Armenian history. To obliterate these episodes the Armenians 
engaged in tailoring history to suit their whims. In this zeal 
they tried to cover up the cold-blooded genocide of 2.5 million 
Turks and Kurds before and during World War I.

And the justice is long overdue.

"For eight days, Armenians have been forcibly obstructing people from
 leaving their homes or going from one village to the other. Day and night
 they are rounding up male inhabitants, taking them to unknown destinations,
 after which nothing further is heard of them. (Informed from statements
 of those who succeeded in escaping wounded from the massacres around
 Taskilise ruins). Women and children are being openly murdered or are
 being gathered in the Church Square and similar places. Most inhuman and
 barbarous acts have been committed against Moslems for eight days."

"As almost all Russian units opposite our front have been withdrawn, the
 population loyal to us in regions behind the Russian positions are
 facing an ever-increasing threat and suppression as well as cruelties
 and abuses by Armenians who have decided to systematically annihilate
 the Moslem population in regions under their occupation. I have 
 regularly informed the Russian Command of these atrocities and
 cruelties and I have gained the impression that the above authority
 seems to be failing in restoring order."
