   I would like to publicly apologize to our Anisa Aldoubosh
   for playing :
****
Well Anisa I am not sure that I feel the necessary remorse.
You and another Muslim lady ( Hanan Ashrawi ) seems to me to
be some attempt to charm the west into forgetting what you
are really saying.
It is not that we hate muslims but we hate certain things you
are saying every now and then. And it is depressing to ponder the 
prospects for peace while those wievs are held by your people.
Not that we are better then you , we have our own prejudices
and vices in the West thank you. But your views are really 
depressing . Thus I have fallen in the temptation to tease
and make a little fun instead of ....
and have problems to mobilize the necessary remorse!

Best Regards
