I really don't know how you can possibly maintain this hypocritical
stance.

On the one hand, you imply that there is a conspiracy of Arab-Americans
that warrants the illegal gathering of information on them (ie. auto license/
registration information in California) and other forms of "monitoring", including
blatant attempts by paid ADL agents to discredit an American-Arab 
organization by trying to distribute Nazi propaganda.  Furthermore,
you attempt to rationalize this through crude stereotyping by pointing 
to the WTC bombing, in which Arab-Americans had no involvement.

On the other hand, you publish this excerpt, which seems to rail
against notions of a racial (Jewish, in this case) conspiracy and
stereotypes.

If you really aren't the hypocrite you appear to be, please explain 
yourself.
