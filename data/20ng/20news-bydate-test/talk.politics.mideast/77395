The whole "saddam is going to invade Saudi Arabia" was nothing but US State
Department propeganda.  Saddam (and Iraq in general) never recognised the 
British created Kuwait.  They were trying to recover land they believed
was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.  The Kuwaitis pushed
just a little too far by taking Iraqi oil and Saddam thought he'd settle
the dispute the old fashioned way...
Everybody would have been much better off had they left the reunited Iraq
together and concentrated on taking out Saddam.  A strong, united Iraq with
an elected government would have gone a long way to ridding the world of
the feudal dictatorships in the Gulf.
But of course a weak divided Arab people better suits US foriegn policy...

The US had no problem killing tens of thousands of ill-equipted Iraqi soldiers,
including burying several thousand alive and slaughtering retreating batallions
from the air in defense of Kuwaiti oil, but it has yet to lift a finger against
Bosnian Serbs while they slaughter Bosnian muslims....
