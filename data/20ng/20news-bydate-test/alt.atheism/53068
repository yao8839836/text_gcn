I am not familiar with, or knowledgeable about the original language,
but I believe there is a word for "idol" and that the translator
would have used the word "idol" instead of "graven image" had
the original said "idol."  So I think you're wrong here, but
then again I could be too.  I just suggesting a way to determine
whether the interpretation you offer is correct.
