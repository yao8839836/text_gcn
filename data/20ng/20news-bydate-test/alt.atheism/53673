Actually, I've got an entire list of books written by various atheist
authors and I went to the largest bookstore in my area (Pittsburgh) and
couldn't find _any_ of them.  What section of the bookstore do you find
these kinds of books in?  Do you have to look in an "alternative" bookstore
for most of them?  Any help would be appreciated (I can send you the list
if you want).

Thanks,
Nanci
