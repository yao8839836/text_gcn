If the Good is undefined (undefinable?) but you require of everyone that
they know innately what is right, you are back to subjectivism.
 
>(2) By defining the Good solely in terms of evaluative terms.
 
Ditto here.  An evaluative statement implies a value judgement on the
part of the person making it.

Please explain how this helps.  I don't see your argument.

This makes no sense either.  Flew is arguing that this is where the
objectivist winds up, not the subjectivist.  Furthermore, the nihilists
believed in nothing *except* science, materialism, revolution, and the
People.

And also not the position of the subjectivist, as has been pointed out
to you already by others.  Ditch the strawman, already, and see my reply
to Mike Cobb's root message in the thread Societal Basis for Morality.
