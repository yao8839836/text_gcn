There are many indications that would have taken place had Saddam
been wanting or planning on going into Saudi Arabia.  There were
none.  This has been openly stated by ex-Pentagon analysts.  Pull.

Actually, reports from other mid-east countries showed that Hussein
was ready to make concessions due to the sanctions.  We just didn't want
him to - we wanted to crush him, as well as battle-test all these high
tech toys we've built over the years.

We're also hypocrites of the first magnitude.  Obviously, we don't give
a shit about freedom and democracy.  All we care about is our oil.  Oh,
and the excuse, now that the Soviets are gone from the board, to keep
a sizable military presence in the gulf region.  Care to make bets about
when ALL our troops will come home?

Basically, Saddam was OK with us.  He was a killer, who tortured his
own people, used gas on them, and other horrors - he was a brutal
dictator, but he was OUR brutal dictator.  Once he said "fuck you" to
the US, he became the next Hitler.  The same for Noriega.  He was a
bastard, but he was OUR bastard...until he changed his mind and went
his own way.  Then we had to get rid of him.
