Ad hominem, sarcastic innuendo?  Absolutely.  Forgotten?  Hardly.
Bored?  Not really.   I try not to confuse "life on a.a." with life.

I just can't overcome the urge to tease/taunt folks who bound FAQ-less
onto a.a. with such a chip on their shoulder.  To listen to you,
one might think we belonged to some church!

I appreciate the patience of others who questioned your posting
on a line-by-line content basis, though it's hard to know what
impact that might have had, as compared to, say, "shovelling".

I think I only lamented that, whatever the initial satisfactions,
past a certain point circular abuse-heaping was just that.

Sincere questions:  Why are you here?  What are you looking for?
