I would recomend to anyone out there to visit your local Christian bookstore
and become aware of the stuff they sell.	Quite
interesting.  Most of the stuff is far from intelectual.  (About the level of
Chick pamphelets...)  If it is a common fundie bookstore, it should have at
least one section about how you should hate Wiccans, Pagans, Catholics,
Mormons, rock musicians, and anyone else who is not as fanatical as them. 
(Hate for the "Love of God(tm)"!) It is even more interesting watching the
people who frequent such places.  Very scary people.  They hear voices from
"God" telling them whatever they want to hear.  (If they were not Christians,
most of them would be locked away.  Maybe this is why Federal money was
reduced to Mental institutions by the reagan administration...	Had to get
their religious leaders out...)

off for good behavior?"
