Bogus. I just said that theism is not the only factor for fanatism.
The point is that theism is *a* factor.

That's a claim you have to support. Please note that especially in the
field of theism, the leaders believe what they say.

That's a straw man. And as usually in discussions with you one has to
repeat it: Read what I have written above: not every theism leads to
fanatism, and not all fanatism is caused by theism. The point is,
there is a correlation, and it comes from innate features of theism.
 
Gullibility, by the way, is one of them.
 
 
And to say that I am going to forbid religion is another of your straw
men. Interesting that you have nothing better to offer.

That's bogus. Self reference is not circular. And since the evaluation of
usefulness is possible within rational systems, it is allowed.
 
Your argument is as silly as proving mathematical statements needs mathematics
and mathematics are therfore circular.

I've been speaking of religious systems with contradictory definitions
of god here.
 
An axiomatic datum lends itself to rational analysis, what you say here
is a an often refuted fallacy. Have a look at the discussion of the
axiom of choice. And further, one can evaluate axioms in larger systems
out of which they are usually derived. "I exist" is derived, if you want
it that way.
 
Further, one can test the consistency and so on of a set of axioms.
 
what is it you are trying to say?

Using the traditonal definition of gods. Personal, supernatural entities
with objective effects on this world. Usually connected to morals and/or
the way the world works.

Person A believes system B becuase it sounds so nice. That does not make
B true, it is at best a work hypothesis. However, the content of B is that
it is true AND that it is more than a work hypothesis. Testing or evaluating
evidence for or against it  therefore dismissed because B (already believed)
says it is wronG/ a waste  of time/ not possible. Depending on the further
contents of B Amalekites/Idolaters/Protestants are to be killed, this can
have interesting effects.
 
Answer the question what the absolute set of morals is people agree on like
they would agree on a football being a football.
