Sigh, now I don't feel so bad.  Searching for a copy in bookstores has
been a habit of mine for at least two years now.  I spend a *lot* of 
time browsing through bookstores, new and and used, and I've not once
seen a copy.  Now, I know, all I do is pick up a phone and order the
darned thing, but come on, this is America and he's one of the founding
fathers.  And no one carries his books?  Sure, you can find "Common
Sense" but I think that's because it's required reading for most
colleges.  

I did find one hole-in-the-wall bookstore where the owner said that they 
usually carry one or two copies, but that they were currently out. I haven't
been back since so I don't know if he was telling the truth or not.

sigh...
