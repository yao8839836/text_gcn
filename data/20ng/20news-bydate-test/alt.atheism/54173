What atheists are you talking about?  

IMNSHO, Abortion is the womans choice.  Homosexual sex is the choice of 
the people involved.  War is sometimes necessary.  

This leaves capital punishment.  I oppose capital punishemnt because 
mistakes can happen (yes this thread went around with no resolution
recently).

As far as poplulation control, I think contraception and education are
the best courses of action.

That's because you are again making the assumption that all Atheists 
have some specific mindset.

Mistakes can happen Bill, and I could be the victim of such a mistake.
