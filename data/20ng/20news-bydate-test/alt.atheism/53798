I believe that there's a 10 year period from time of death until
a person can be on a commemorative stamp.  It was broken once
for Lyndon Johnson (I think) but other than that it has held for
awhile.  Of course, we can still start now -- the Elvis stamp
was petitioned for ages and things really moved once it got
past the 10 year anniversary of his death.
