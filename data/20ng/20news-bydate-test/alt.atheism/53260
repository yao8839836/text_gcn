Gregg, you haven't provided even a title of an article to support *your*

You also have no reason to believe it *is* an anti-Islamic slander job, apart
from your own prejudices.

Why, yes.  What's a mere report in The Times stating that BCCI followed
Islamic banking rules?  Gregg *knows* Islam is good, and he *knows* BCCI were
bad, therefore BCCI *cannot* have been Islamic.  Anyone who says otherwise is
obviously spreading slanderous propaganda.

I see.  If someone wants to provide references to articles you agree with,
you will also respond with references to articles you agree with?  Mmm, yes,
that would be a very intellectually stimulating debate.  Doubtless that's how
you spend your time in soc.culture.islam.

The more you post, the more I become convinced that it is simply a waste of
time to try and reason with Moslems.  Is that what you are hoping to achieve?
