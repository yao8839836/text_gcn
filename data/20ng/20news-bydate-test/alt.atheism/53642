#"Motivates" or "allows?"    The Christian Bible says that one may kill

#certain circumstances.     

I'd say the majority of people have a moral system that instructs them
to kill under certain circumstances.  I do get your distinction between
motivate and allow, and I do agree that if a flavour of theism 'allows'
atoricities, then that's an indictment of that theism.  But it rather
depends on what the 'certain circumstances' are.  When you talk about
Christianity, or Islam, then at least your claims can be understood.
It's when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls
apart.  One could believe in a God which instructs one to be utterly
harmless.

Not necessarily.  "Love thy neighbour" does not supply a them/us - it
demolishes it.  And my definition of religion is broader than my
definition of theism, as I have explained.

#
#What about the Protestant extremists who killed four Catholic 
#labourers?     That *wasn't* religiously motivated?

Not in my opinion.  If they were doing it because of some obscure
point of theology, then yes.  But since all protestants don't do this
(nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), it's just too broad
too say "religion did this".  I'm saying that the causes are far more
complex than that - take away the religious element, and you'd still
have the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism.  You
know, when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say 'stop the 
killing', one might listen to that, especially when you claim not
to read minds.

#
#What's so special about these exceptions?    Isn't this all just a

#all this?

The general principle is that it's fairly clear (to me, at least) that
religion is the primary motivator (enabler, whatever) of these.  It's
not nearly so obvious what's going on when one looks at NI, apart
from violence of course.

#I'm still listening to what they say, and you are still telling us

You've speculated on my motives often enough, and you don't take
my statements of my own beliefs at face value - therefore your claim 
not to read minds has no credibility with me, sorry.   I also note that 
you fail to answer my question.  It just looks to me very much like
you have an axe to grind - especially as you are indeed ignoring what 
most Protestants say - which is @stop the killing".  The people you
refer to are properly described as Unionists, not Protestants.
#
#As for their position of privilege, what is that if not religion-
#based?

It is based on politics, bigotry, and heartless extremism.  None of these
things are synonymous with religion, though there is certainly some
overlap.
