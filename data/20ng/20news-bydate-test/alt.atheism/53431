Absolutely not true. Without religion - either an established one or
one you invent for yourself - the theist and atheist are equally
(not) interested in God, because without religious revelation there
is _no_ information about God available. Strip away the dogma and
the theists/atheists are no different, simply holding a different
opinion on a matter of little practical importance.

Sorry, but that doesn't help. What test will you apply to decide
whether it is God or Satan with whom you are speaking?
How will you know that you have not simply gone insane, or having
delusions? You are like a loaded gun.

Ah, you not as stupid as I assumed. :-)

Yes. We're all in this together - each human making up a small part of
the definition of humanity.
