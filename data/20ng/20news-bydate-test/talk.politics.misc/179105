	The place has burned to the ground.  The FBI and company
have the whole area cordoned off and have already arrested 
reporters for being at the site and taking pictures.

	All your going to get in terms of a story is what the FBI, ATF
and the Texas Rangers decide to release.

	When the Philadephia cops dropped their bomb on MOVE and
managed to burn down an entire neighborhood many people said 
the same thing.  Dead men and rubble tell no tales that the
police dont want them to tell.  

	You can judge the real political mood on this from the
fact that Congressperson Pat Scroder is a 100% supporter of
the FBI's actions.  She was on television this week saying that
the cost of the operation in Waco was a valid reason for the
storming and gassing of the compound.
