Sorry, but this is a red herring.

Are you contending that the "mountain of forms" are processed by Blue
Cross?  Having had Blue Cross insurance both as a government employee
and as an employee of a private corporation, I saw no difference between
the two sets of forms.  

Moreover, the administrative costs associated with Medicare/Medicaid,
the two primary forms of "government" insurance are considerably lower than
the average for private insurance companies.   (5% versus 14%-16%).

If you have any evidence that Blue Cross bears a heavier burden in insuring
government employees than private employees, post it.  Otherwise, try
to stick to factual assertions.

Well now, that's an interesting defense of the "free enterprise" system.
Are you contending that it is government intervention that prevents 
private insurance companies from "standardizing?"

In fact, it is true that some of the red-tape burden stems from the 
lack of standardization among the 1500 or so private insurers in the US,
but it's a little difficult to understand how this is anything other than
"free enterprise" at work.  

By the way, Barron's, the bible of Wall Street, this week admitted that
administrative costs were significantly lower in Canada because "....a
single-payer system is always cheaper...".  Guess even the "free enterprise
advocates" are beginning to see the light.

Sorry, but you seem to be confusing proposals with health care
reform with the Bush administration's gag order on federally funded family
planning clinics.  There are no proposals that would control what your
"doctor...can and cannot say about medical procedures."

Try again.
