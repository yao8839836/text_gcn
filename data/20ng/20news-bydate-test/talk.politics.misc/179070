The arrest of Noriega did not have any major adverse effect on the
drug trade going through Panama. Money laundering continues to be
Panama's main industry. In fact, it is bigger now than before Noriega
was arrested [1]. Panama's current administration also has ties with
the Colombian cocaine cartels [2]. And large amounts cocaine still
flow through Panama on a regular basis [3].

Oh well...
