I *cannot* *believe* I am posting in this thread, but what
the hell, he asked for it.

I had sort of the same reaction myself when I was first realizing
I was bi.  "So what, >90% of everyone else is straight, I'd never
end up with a guy anyway."  As several people on soc.bi pointed
out to me, this is true only if you find partners (for relationships
or just for sex) in primarily straight circles.  Nowadays with gay
culture quite visible in major cities and such, you can easily
find yourself in an overwhelmingly queer social circle if you so
choose.  (About half my friends are bi, and that's just from
hanging out in the science fiction club and going to UCBU once a
week, it's not as if I have to go out of my way and hang out in
bars or something.)

So the available pool for dates can be the same size.  Unless of
course you're trying to date a random sample of the US population.

As for promiscuity, I've traded email with Clayton on the topic,
and he still doesn't seem to want to admit that yes, gay males
are sometimes forced to resort to anonymous sex because they're
closeted and can't afford to be seen in a permanent relationship.
Or that part of the promiscuity is because of the messed-up gender
roles in our society, and when males are dating males and they've
*all* been trained to be the aggressor in sex, there's going to
be more sex.  Or that what's "dysfunctional", what's "screwed up"
is societal attitudes, not gay sexuality, and that's what 
encourages deviant behavior in gay males.

(also note that just because someone's had 200 sex partners 
doesn't mean they're promiscuous.  yes, it sounds ridiculous,
but it's quite possible for someone to go through a heavily
closeted phase in which they have lots of anonymous sex with
strangers, and then come out, start forming real relationships,
and be monogamous or nearly so...)
