Gosh, Tim, you must have seen a different live broadcast than I did. While
the smoke did emerge from one place initially, it was a considerable
distance from the tank, and in a very short time, fire appeared at several
places a good distance apart from there.

Then there's that nagging question about why, out of all those people,
only a few made any attempts to escape or save the children. If it were
me, with my child, [and I wasn't committing suicide,] I believe I would have
made SOME attempt to at least save the child. As it was, at least one of
the survivors was attempting to GO BACK INTO THE FIRE when they were
physically removed. No one lifted a finger to bring out a child, apparently.

How do you explain that? And the two survivors who claimed to have doused
the place with lantern oil and SET the fire (no doubt on David's orders). 
[At least until the lawyers talked to them.] 

Tim> And also, why have they not yet released the search warrant????  

That *is* a good question. Maybe because it would be a further
embarrassment, seeing as how the ATF went in there in Dirty Harry mode
initially. 

As stupidly as it all was handled, I find it difficult to believe that the
entire FBI has completely gone corrupt under a new administration less
than 100 days old. Stupidity and bad decisions and plans have always been
with us. They just had an alignment at Waco.

Tim> Seeeeee Ya  turmoil@halcyon.com   FUCK THE POLICE!!!!

See? Freedom of speech abounds.
