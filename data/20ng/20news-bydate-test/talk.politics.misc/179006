	It's fairly simple. It was decided to burn the place down,
	and more than one agent was dispatched to set the fires in
	separate parts of the compound. I doubt that "simultaneously"
	means "at the exact same time" in this case. It likely means
	"close enough together to preclude them from being part of
	the same fire."

	They might be waiting until the evidence comes in from the
	site, and the investigation is at least well underway.

	The same could be said of Jonestown.

	Maybe. Then again, I've been suprised at what folks have missed
	in the past in similar situations. Don't jump t oconclusions.
