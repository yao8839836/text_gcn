Watch the videotape carefully, the CNN coverage was fairly decisive.

The first fire starts in the Tower, this is three storeys high and there
is a flag to the right of it on the picture. The second fire starts 
in another tower which is similar to the first only two storeys high.
The flag is on the left in the camera picture that shows this fire
starting.

Thus the camera pictures cleraly show the fire starting at two separate
locations. The FBI report a third. I was not able to verify it from the
videotape however someone else identified a fire shown to be starting behind
the small tower in the second (flag on left) camera angle.


The flames coming out of the building are yellow/orange. This is the
normal colour for carbon compounds burning. The flames were those of a 
solid or confined liquid burning, not of a gas exploding. 


The explosion that occurs mid way along the building is certainly not an
explosive though. The cloud itself is on fire. This would seem to
be most likely to be some sort of fuel oil store exploding rather than
the explosion of a magazine.

Depends entirely on how they were distributed. You would not be able
to identify ammunition rounds going off from video camera coverage
from a mile away. If and when the FBI release pictures from cmeras
on the armoured vehicles (which presumably exist) it might be possible to 
get a clearer picture. 

If anyone expects to see explosions hollywood style aka Rambo movies then
remember that in real life cars do not burst into flames when going over cliffs.

Just about the most you could expect would be to see the grenades
going off. Since the building was designed to be blast proof to some
extent it would be difficult to distinguish the grenades going off from
the collapse of the building due to the fire.

Paranoia.

You wouldn't beleive the FBI if they showed you a picture of Koresh himself
setting light to the place. Your mindset is such that you are simply
unable to accept as true anything that might suggest that a group of
heavily armed weapons fanatics might indeed be in the wrong.

The gun lobby can't accept that the B-D set light to the place because
that would mean that Koreh had murdered 17 children, that would mean that
their taking his account of the murder of 4 BATF agents would be even
less credible than it was to start with.

Koresh had 51 days to come out with his hands up and face a fair trial. 
Instead he ordered the murder of everyone in the place.
