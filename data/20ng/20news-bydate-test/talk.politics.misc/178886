You mean, in the 1940s, men and women were much more open about
their homosexuality than today?  Want to try that one again?

You mean, ignore study after study, so that we can continue to 
accept a study (Kinsey's) that is obviously wrong?  

# As for myself, I'm a heterosexual and I've never considered having

Based on what, besides your own warm fuzzy feelings?

# Here's something to ponder upon:  have any of you gay-bashers out
# there ever considered that homosexuals probably deem their sexual
# orientation as being a state of affairs that is just as much an
# intrinsic and "natural" part of their life as heterosexuals do
# about their own sexuality?  In other words, someone who is *truly*

Alcoholics share that feeling, until they hit bottom.

# of the opposite sex or get married, in their *heart* they are still a
# homosexual.  Likewise, if someone who is *truly* heterosexual forms
# a relationship with someone of the same sex, then they are *still*
# a heterosexual even though outward appearances may suggest otherwise.

Unless, of course, the problem is that homosexuality is a form
of mental disorder, caused by childhood sexual abuse, as a number of
recent works suggest.

If homosexuals would stop using the government to impose their
morality on others (antidiscrimination laws) and leave our children
alone, I wouldn't care in the least what they did in private.  But
until they get over the liberal notion that the proper role of 
government is to tell peaceful people how to live, I have no choice
but to continue to point out that homosexuality is not an "alternative
lifestyle," but a sickness.
