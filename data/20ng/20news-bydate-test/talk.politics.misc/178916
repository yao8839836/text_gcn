"We're Number One in percentage of population without health insurance. 
******************************************************************

"The main reason we're Number One in  percentage of population without
health  insurance  is  that we're last  in  percentage  of  population
covered  by public health insurance. Only about one fifth of Americans
qualify for the main types of public health insurance available in the
United States: Medicare, Medicaid, and veterans' benefits.(2l)

"Of those  who don't  qualify, many  have private  insurance.(22)  But
almost  one  in  seven  Americans  (34  million people--most living in
families with a working adult) have  no insurance  at  all, and one in
four (63 million) have been without insurance for a substantial period
of time during the last two years. Many more have inadequate coverage,
meaning that they could be bankrupted by a major illness.(23) In fact,
one  health  care  expert  says that because  only 1  percent  of  the
population  has   private   longterm-care  insurance,  "virtually  any
American could be  impoverished by a prolonged disabling illness."(24)
Additionally, as many as  40 percent of those  eligible for some forms
of public aid do not  receive  it. These  gaps in health  care  result
directly from  the  fact  that  the  United  States is  the only major
industrialized  nation (other than  South Africa) without  a  national
health insurance  plan providing  universal coverage while controlling
costs.

    ``America is becoming a land of private greed and public squalor.     
    This book is an indispensable road map through the wreckage. The     
    facts it reveals will startle you. They may depress you. But     
    ideally they'll fire you up to help rebuild this nation.''
