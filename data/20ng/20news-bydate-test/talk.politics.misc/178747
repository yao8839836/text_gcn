        As you're no doubt aware, Phill, there are probably five or six
different, mutually contradictory versions of the events in Waco on
Feb. 28 all of which are from reputable news sources, ranging the the 
Associated Press to TIME to Newsweek.

        Some of the earliest reports issued by the AP were not at all
flattering the to BATF, and produced some question as to who fired first.

        Now, for all I know, you were there to witness it.  But
I kind of doubt that.

        The BATF, in a letter they've been sending out to people,
says both that they were ambushed because they lost the element of
surprise, and that they went up and knocked on the door and had it
slammed in their faces.

        It strikes *me* as kind of strange to rely on surprise to
serve a warrant by knocking on the door.

        There are at least questions that need to be answered.

>assault assumes that the BATF were on a death wish. 

        This paranoid assertation was made by witnesses to the original
assault who stated that the BATF initiated hostilities by throwing
concussion grenades and reported by the Associated Press.

        Phill, the BATF were in a firefight with the BD for *forty-five*
minutes.  I find it hard to believe that if they were expecting peaceful
citizens they *wouldn't* have shown up in live-stock trailers and would
have retreated immediately.

        If they *were* expecting peacful citizens, why show up with over
a hundred officers, some of which clearly visible on video to be carrying 
sub-machineguns, and *3* National Guard Helicopters?

        I don't know who did what, but, as I said, there are questions that 
need to be answered.
