	They certainly knew that there were pregnant women in there plus 
children.  I could not believe when they said that the gassing was
an attempt to "save the children" yesterday.  I can't think of a much
worse sort of child abuse that pouring tear gas into a building.

	I have heard two things recently explaining this:

	1. They pumped the gas into the building from outside via some
	sort of pipe rather than by canister.

	2. The sort of tear gas they are using was described as some
	sort of powdery material that sticks to things.  Kind of
	like a powder cloud.

	And once again, these are government lacky explainations and
	since government stories always change, none or all of the
	information might not be true.

	Or better yet, the Texas rangers will be investigating which is
probably worse than the FBI or ATF investigating itself.
