I don't expect to be hired based on my sexual orientation.  If someone
decides he wants a gay-only staff of employees, that's his business.
I won't force him to hire heterosexuals; please don't force me to
hire homosexuals.

No.  I'm saying it's none of the government's business what two

homosexuals.
