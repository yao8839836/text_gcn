	Excuse me? Quality? As in grade A CO2 and grade B CO2? I may not have
this quite right but I was under the impression that CO2 was CO2.

 Furthermore,

	A) There is no reason to believe this system is inherently stable- 
The Ice ages occured without any help from humans.

	B) The point was that the human contribution of CO2 and other 
greenhouse gasses is insignificant and it won't really make a difference if
we make more or less.

	C) What overwhelming data? I see lots of 'projections' of the future,
which is fascinating, considering they can't predict the weather two weeks
in advance.
