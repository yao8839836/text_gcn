Presumably the B-D did not mount a continuous state of alert with gunmen
ready to fire on people who casually walked up to ring the doorbell.

Once inside the building the BATF would have been in control. Trained
police officers are a match to any bunch of Bozos playing at soldiers.

Not a smart move. Unless meant to be part of the surprize cover. Even so
the narrow opening of the trucks simply was not a good idea. A side opening
truck would have been much better, more like a covered waggon.

Sounds just about right to me. Its the minimum amount of force that I
would consider necessary to serve a warrant on the talk.politics.guns
annual dinner.

Michael Hesseltine ordered the use of over 5000 crack troops including
members of the parachute regiment to remove approx 250 hippy peace
protestors on a site where they wanted to install cruise missiles. He
even turned up in a flack jacket to monitor the proceedings. Just about the
most dangerous tool the women possesed was a tin opener. That single
action probably cost him the position as Prime Minister. One of the elders
of my church got arrested in that heroic action by the forces of Toryism.
Hesseltine ever after was something of a national joke.
