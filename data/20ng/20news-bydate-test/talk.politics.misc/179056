1. You haven't shown any disproportionate involvement.

2. The Janus Report, which came out recently, gives 9% as the percentage
of exclusively or predominantly gay men.

3. No one is presumably going to say they're gay if they're not. But
some no doubt are going to hide their homosexuality in surveys. Thus
the 1-2% is a lower limit.

I still say that weighing all the evidence gives a most likely percentage
between 5 and 7%.
