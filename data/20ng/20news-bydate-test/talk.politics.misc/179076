    ``America is becoming a land of private greed and public squalor.     
    This book is an indispensable road map through the wreckage. The     
    facts it reveals will startle you. They may depress you. But     
    ideally they'll fire you up to help rebuild this nation.'' 

                        -Robert B. Reich, author of The Work of Nations
