You miss the point.  A lot more negotiation is needed to convince women
to have sex because there is a big taboo about women being free with 
their sex.  Many of the women I know would do almost anything rather
than be known as a slag, slut or whore.

With men however there is *status* attached to being able to fuck 
constantly.  And with gay men, where both partners can prove status
through their constant verility then you are going to get a situation
where there is a lot of sex.

The difference is between het sex being rationed as a valuable commodity
and gay sex being virtually unlimited due to the *appetites* of men.

Straights suffer a bottle neck where women are concerned, gay men who
do not experience this bottle neck go to excess.
