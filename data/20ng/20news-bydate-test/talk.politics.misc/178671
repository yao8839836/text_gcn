    The first thing I would do would be to disband Medicare and Medicade!  They
are a primary reason why health care costs are going up.  To cover the people
that are currently on these programs, I would sell their coverage in blocks
to insurance companies.  The private companies would bid to get these large
blocks of people, and prices would go down.

    To get away from strong federal control on health care, I would pass off
more control to the states.  Everyone is always spewing forth about how 
wonderful Hawaii is doing.  Well, how about giving some other STATES incentive
to try their own plans

    What I would NOT do is try to implement some far reaching federal program
program to cover all Americans, because this is the surest way to fail!

   One sure way to stop throwing money away is to stop giving so much to the
federal government.  Our FEDERAL taxes should be slashed, and our STATE taxes
increased.  A strong central government always fails.  Give power back to the
states/counties/cities, where it belongs.

  The more I inform myself, the more I want to Hillary-bash.  :->
