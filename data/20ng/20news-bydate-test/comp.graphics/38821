ROME REBORN:  THE VATICAN LIBRARY AND RENAISSANCE CULTURE
presents some 200 of the Vatican Library's most precious
manuscripts, books, and maps--many of which played a key role in
the humanist recovery of the classical heritage of Greece and
Rome.  The exhibition presents the untold story of the Vatican
Library as the intellectual driving force behind the emergence of
Rome as a political and scholarly superpower during the
Renaissance.  The exhibit will be on display in the Jefferson
Building of the Library of Congress from January 8, 1993 through
April 30, 1993.  The online exhibit will be available by
anonymous FTP indefinitely.

     The exhibit is divided into nine (9) sections:  The Vatican
Library, Archaeology, Humanism, Mathematics, Music, Medicine &
Biology, Nature Described, A Wider World I: How the Orient Came
to Rome, and A Wider World II: How Rome Went to China.  Each
section consists of its own sub-directory within the /exhibit
directory and contains the exhibit text for that section and
separate JPEG image files for each object.  This online exhibit
includes not only objects from the Library of Congress exhibit,
but also the alternate objects (brought from Rome to be used if
there were a problem with one of the primary objects) and items
omitted later in the planning process.

     This exhibit will be of interest to Medieval and Renaissance
scholars in particular, but also to art historians, historians of
science or medicine, early music scholars, students of the
humanist movement, students of printing and the printed word,
theologians, scholars of both Far and Near Eastern studies, and
to librarians and information professionals.  Please get the
README file for details on what files this exhibit contains.  If
you have questions about how to use FTP, speak to your local
computer support person.  If you have questions or comments about
the CONTENT of the exhibit, please write to vatican@kell.loc.gov
while if you have any questions or comments on the SYSTEM please
contact me.
