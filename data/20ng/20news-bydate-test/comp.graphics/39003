Look be consistent. First you post something that seems to suggest that you see
xv being an 8 bit program as some sort of error. 
So I post and asy it is not a bug, it is meant to be like that. 
So you post and say it is not a bug, you never said it was, I have misunderstood
etc.
Now you are saying:

>We discussed about error(s) in XV 2.21 which shows images only as 8bit,

If you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the
discussion a *lot* easier.

Eh? Sorry, I don't understand what you are saying here. I am aware that English is
not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning, but this
paragraph defeats me.

Yes *as I originally said*, global changes are easily possible.

But this statement contradicts what you said earlier:

>>>with 8bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file
>>>process we have to make the modifications to the 24bit image.

No I don't think so actually. 

You were talking about loading a 24 bit image into xv (by quantising),
manipulating the colours in the colour editor, then somewhow applying these
changes to the 24 bit file when you exit xv. Xv lets you edit individual
colours. Where is this sudden jumping off the topic?

Yes I am aware there is no colourmap in a 24 bit file!!

I do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean.

???
What are you saying
???

Ah! now we see thew problem! First you want to extend xv to allow editing of 8
bit previews of 24 bit images. Then I point out problems with this. Now you are
saying there is no problem because you, personally, happen not to use those
parts of the program that cause the problem!!

Not sure what you are saying here. Certainly one can make local changes.

Yes that is one possible approach. I would find a program that took such an
approach clumsy, however.

Well here we agree - you have not thought it through very much. You don't seem
to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the
next. OK, we all have off days - perhaps you should step back and think this one
through.

>>Yes again. What *is* (was?) wrong with xv?

>designed for that.

As I said in the last post, JPEG is a compression algorithm. It is a way of
saving disk space by trading off quality against compression. I fail to see what
the problem is. You have not proposed any workable alternatives.

>Also, human expect that 24bit will be saved as 24bit image; 

Speak for yourself. You are the *only* person I have met or spoken to who,
having quantised a 24 bit image down to 8 bits, expects this process to somehow
reverse when the file is saved; keeping all modificvations that heve been made
to the 8 bit image palette.

Perhaps that is why you yused the singular?

>say,
>person would like to crop part of the image and save it, then it is
>expected that the image still is the same. 

Look, next time you import a 24 bit image into xv look carefully at the main
control panel - it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the 8 bit
image. XV makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original 24 bit
file. You are the *only* person who claims this is confusing.

>So, XV were designed

Is a design error the same as a bug? ;-)

Read my lips. XV is a program for viewing and modifying 8 bit images. It lets
you import other images. It shows, I would say, a good deal of thought about the
human interface. And everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it
was designed for. It makes no false claims.

If you would come up with a solid, logical, well argued and lucid description of
precisely how these proposed extensions would work, feel free to post them. So 
far, you have not done so.

>So, even all screen images are 8bit, the processed images and saved
>images could have been 24bit very easily, instead of 8bit.

Argh!! After all this, a comment like that. `Very easily'. OK, go ahead and code it
if it is so easy.

Or alternatively, look up the terms `import' and 'non-reversible transformation'.

I think this is a bit of an exageration.

What you are actually saying is, you got into a lift (elevator, if you are in
the states ;-) ) and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up. Everyone else
had no problem. Now you are trying to sue the manufacturer...

>Well, my text may be a bit hard reading,

Mostly. Leaving aside the language issue however, it betrays some very wooly
thinking (as you yourself admit) which is the same in any language. Go think
some more.
