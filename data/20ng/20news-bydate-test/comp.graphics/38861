Okay, I got enough replies about the Kubota Kenai/Denali systems that I
will post a summary of their capabilities.  I haven't actually used one
or seen one, so take the specs with a grain of salt.  I'd like to see
an independent review of one against, say, an SGI Indigo Extreme or
something.

Basically, the Kenai workstations are DEC Alpha AXP based workstations that
run OSF/1 ( DEC's ) and will likely run Windows NT in the future.  They are
binary compatible with Digital's OSF/1 Alpha AXP implementation.  Denali
is their graphics subsystem, which is upgradable in the field by
simply adding "transformation engines".

The two main Kenai machines are the 3400 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation
and the 3500 Imaging and 3D Graphics Workstation.

Z-buffer		24-bit			24-bit
Alpha/stencil		8-bit			8-bit
Stereo support		yes			yes
Other:				both machines will double buffer or do
				stereo output per window.  Both have an
				auxiliary video output that is RS-170A,
				NTSC, and PAL

STORAGE

IO

Both have TurboChannel 100MB/sec, SCSI-2, Ethernet, and FDDI

APPLICATION PROGRAMMING INTERFACES

Both have libraries for Xlib, Motif, MIT PEXlib, DEC-PEXlib DEC-PHIGS, and GL

Okay, now the real stuff.  The Kenai stations work with a graphics architecture
known as Denali.  The Denali comes in three models, the E, P, and V.  They
use a DECchip 21064 superscalar RISC processor at 150MHz.  Their
capabilities are as follows:

			E		P		V

As you can see, these are pretty powerful workstations, and the best part
is the pricing.  I would recommend that you call Kubota for more information.
Their number is 408-727-8100.  I'm sure they'll send you an information you
may want.  Oh, some prices:

Low-end

Kenai 3400, E Series w/ 1 TEM and 5 FBM --- 27,795 dollars U.S.
Kenai 3500, E Series w/ 1 TEM and 5 FBM --- 45,345 dollars U.S.

High-end

Kenai 3400, V Series w/ 6 TEM and 20 FBM -- 61,795 dollars U.S.
Kenai 3500, V Series w/ 6 TEM and 20 FBM -- 79,345 dollars U.S.

If someone could post a relative comparision with an Indigo Extreme or
something I would appreciate it.

Hope this helps someone out there,

Brian

PS I am not affiliated with Kubota in any way.  Hell, I thought they made
tractors or something. :-)
