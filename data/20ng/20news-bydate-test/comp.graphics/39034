I worked in support for a while at a company and we had problems with several
Toshiba 1600's in a short space of time. They were all around 2 years old.
Some screens went completely (as above), others were just "dodgy".

This happened to about 5 or 6 out of, maybe 100. They were fairly reliable up
to then and I don't think it was a special problem with Tosh's (no link to the
company). So I would think that 21 months may not be unreasonable - just
unlucky!
