Well, I am placing a file at my ftp today that contains several
polygonal descriptions of a head, face, skull, vase, etc. The format
of the files is a list of vertices, normals, and triangles. There are
various resolutions and the name of the data file includes the number
of polygons, eg. phred.1.3k.vbl contains 1300 polygons.


In order to get the data via ftp do the following:

	1) ftp taurus.cs.nps.navy.mil
	2) login as anonymous, guest as the password
	3) cd pub/dabro
	4) binary
	5) get cyber.tar.Z

Once you get the data onto your workstation:

	1) uncompress data.tar.Z
	2) tar xvof data.tar

If you have any questions, please let me know.
