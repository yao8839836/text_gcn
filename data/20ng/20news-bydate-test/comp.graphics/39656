The GL file is an archive containing individual frames or pieces of
frames (usually stored as .PIC or .CLP files), fonts, and a .TXT file
that tells the GRASP animation system how to display it.  GL stands
for Grasp Library.  There is probably a detailed discussion of this subject
in the alt.binaries.pictures FAQ.

There are freely distributable viewers for GL files, and they are usually
named GRASPRT?.EXE (replace the ? with a version digit or letter).  Most
GL files contain frames that are hardware-specific to particular modes
of the CGA, EGA, or VGA adapters on PCs.  I think that there are some
copies of GRASPRT available by anonymous ftp (I know that I got one there
a long time ago).

		Good Luck
