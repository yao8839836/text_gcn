The OTIS Project presents...

       SYNERGY: Revolt 
	...the first in a continuing series of collaborative
	art initiatives designed to exploit the binarity
	of the infosphere.  This series of diversely 
	structured art-manipulation projects will attempt
	to stretch across network boundries encouraging
	use of electronic mail, fax, video, photography,
	scanned "conventional" art and even sound to 
	create multi-artist "still" visuals in GIF and 
	JPG formats.  Visualists from all technical levels
	are welcome.  

	REVOLT will be structured simply.  There will be 
	three stages of production.  The first stage will
	consist of all participants creating one still 
	work as a "starter" piece that two other partici-
	pants will, in turn, manipulate.  All first stage
	"base" images are due by Sunday, May 23rd, 1993, 
	midnight Central Daylight Time. 

	Stage two will begin on May 24th.  All images will 
	be sent to another (arbitrarily chosen) participant
	for them to do manipulations on in anyway they see 
	fit.  For purely digital artists, this may consist
	of filtering the image through their favorite paint
	program.  For "analog" artists, this may well be
	printing a hardcopy of the image and adding their
	own part with pen, pencil or white-out then scan-
	ning in the image again to be transferred on to 
	the third-stage artist.  All second-stage works
	are due by midnight on Sunday, May 30th.

	Stage three is the finishing stage and will begin
	on May 31st.  All artists will do what they think 
	it takes to finish up the image they've been given
	using whatever technique they see as worthy.  
	These images will be due on June 6th, midnight.

	All involved will participate in each stage of
	creation.
