Hello,
 
I've been on the DKBtrace/PoVray mailing list out of trearn.bitnet
for some time now, but when I tried to post the other day the
listserv told me that the list doesn't exist!  So I got a global
list of groups from the listserv and - - NOTHING!  I grepped every
string I could think of.  If Frank, Ville Saari, Andre Beck, or anyone
else who's a regular on DKB-L can tell me what is going on, please do!
 
Regards,
