RH>I've noticed that if you only save a model (with all your mapping planes

RH>3DS, they are given a default position and orientation.  But if you save

    This is because the PRJ (Project) format saves all of your settings,
    right down to the last render file's name.

RH>I'd like to be able to read the texture rule information, does anyone have
RH>the format for the .PRJ file?

    Sorry... Don't have anything on that or the CEL format.
