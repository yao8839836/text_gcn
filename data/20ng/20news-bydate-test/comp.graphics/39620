amen.. I too have learned by example, specifically yours. :)

.. but dorsai leads the way.. Unlike other services that are commercial
in nature, dorsai is a community based service. While others charge
monthly fees for access, dorsai accepts donations from those who can
afford to contribute.

   While other systems don't respond to user input, dorsai thrives on it.
Other systems sell hardware for a profit, dorsai donates hardware to
community service groups, and to individuals who couldn't afford to
normally.

   Dorsai lives due to the "hacker" ethic of Charles, Jack, Skip, Cara,
Ira, Mark, David etc etc etc..  sleepless nights and days working on
equipment thats been assembled at the embassy, ( and modifying what
ever else available to work the first time..) in order to keep the
slip line up...

   Heres to you bud... I'm one of the few that decided to
stay, and am damn glad that I did..... :)
