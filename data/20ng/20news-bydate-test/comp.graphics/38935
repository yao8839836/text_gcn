I am considering creating a "demo" for the IBM PC for my band.
I would like to combine interesting graphics and a sample of 
my music in the program.  I have seen things like this
done for other platforms, and even a few for the PC, but since
I'm completly new to this, I have no idea wher to start.
I'm pretty sure that I am not skilled enough to put this 
together, but I was hoping that you (collectivly) could
A. Let me know what issues I need to worry about, things I
   Should take into consideration when developing the 
   concept.
B. Perhaps someone knows of a programmer/artist who would be interested
   in this type of a project.

I know these are rather broad questions, but any information
would be most helpful.  Thanks!!
