I am looking for a means to add FLI and FLC animation creation
to a Windows application.  I was hoping for something along the lines
of AAWIN or AAPLAY by Autodesk but for the creation of these delta 
compressed animations.  I have FLILIB but this seems to be coded for 
the Large memory model of DOS with Turbo C. Ideally I would
like a DLL or Medium model object library, but would settle
for anything, really.  I've seen other Windows apps with
FLI/FLC creation, did they hack the FLILIB code into submission?

Any pointers would be appreciated, please send mail directly
to me and I will summarize the results if there is interest.
