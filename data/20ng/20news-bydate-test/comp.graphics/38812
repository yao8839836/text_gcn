Hi!

We have an old Montage FR-1 35mm film recorder. When connected to a PC with
its processor card it can directly take HPGL, Targa and Lasergraphics Language
files. 24 bit Targa is quite OK for raster images, but conversion from 
whatever one happens to have can be quite slow. This Lasergraphics Language
seems to be (got the source file for one test image) a vector-based language
that can handle one million colors. It does some polygons too, and perhaps
something else ?

The question is, where can I find some information about this language ?
A FTP site, a book, a company address,.... ?

(OK, it would be nice to have a Windows driver for it, but I'm not THAT
optimistic...)

Thanks in advance for any help!
