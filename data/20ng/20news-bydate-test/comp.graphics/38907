 I have a copy of 'The Earth-From Space' on my wall that I purchased
from Space Shots, Inc. (LA, CA  (800) 272-2779).  As printed on the
poster, the image was created by Tom Van Sant and the GeoSphere Project.
The image IS copyrighted, so I doubt that you'll find it legally in
the public domain.  Part of the proceeds from the sale of the image go to the 
GeoSphere Project (an environmental education thing), and the cost is
nominal, so crack a 20 and buy one!  Also, I don't think it's always
safe to assume that just because the government 'funded' a project, any
products will be provided for free.  Many government agencies (NASA, NOAA)
and some private groups (National Geographic) provided assistance to the
GeoSphere Project.  This collaboration seems to be mostly oriented to
educating the public, rather than pure research.

Who turned off the lights?  What's that funny noise? I feel strange...
