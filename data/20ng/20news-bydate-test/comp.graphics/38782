EUROPEAN COMPUTER RESEARCH CENTRE

Research Positions in 3D Graphics

ECRC is currently expanding its research staff in three-dimensional
graphics. We are looking for highly qualified researchers with a PhD in
computer science and a proven ability to conduct highly innovative
research. Preference will be given to candidates who have strong
experience in developing and implementing algorithms for
three-dimensional graphics, visualization and user interaction. We
presently have positions available for both experienced researchers and
recent graduates.  Candidates with especially strong backgrounds may be
considered for positions as visiting scientists or for Ph.D. student
research positions.

The European Computer-Industry Research Centre is located in Munich,
Germany with English as the working language. The centre is funded by a
consortium of major computer companies, with a mission to pursue
research in fundamental areas of computer science. Active areas of
research include visualization and user interfaces, distributed
computing, parallelism, deductive systems and databases. The center
employs 45 researchers of 21 different nationalities.

The small but rapidly growing graphics group is currently investigating
new methods for three-dimensional human-computer interaction and the
integration of computer vision and computer graphics technology. The
center has extensive computing facilities which includes Sun
workstations, Apple Macintoshes, a well equipped graphics laboratory and
network access to super-computer facilities.

ECRC offers competitive salaries and excellent benefits. For immediate
consideration, send a written application with curriculum vitae,
telephone number, e-mail address, and references to: Douglas Greer, ECRC
