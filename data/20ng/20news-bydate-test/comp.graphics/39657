I'm also interested in info both public domain and commercial graphics library 
package to do PC VGA graphics.  

I'm currently working on a realtime application running on a PCC with a 
non-DOS kernel that needs to do some simple graphics.  I'm not sure if 
reentrancy of the graphics library is going to be an issue or not.  
I suspect I'll implement the display controller as a server process that 
handles graphics requests, queued on a mailbox, one at a time.  If this 
provides sufficiently frequent display updates then I believe that I can 
restrict all graphics operations to be performed by the server and thus 
constrain access to the library to a this single process and avoid the need
for a reentrant graphics library.  

Being fairly new to the realtime systems world I may be overlooking something,
what do you think?
