If some kind person has access to a mathematical package such as Mathematica,
Maple,... I would like to ask you for the solution to the following problem.
I sometimes have algebra problems like this where I would like a simplified
symbolic solution. Is there a FTP-able package out there that can handle such
beasts?

    I would like to solve the following ray - Bezier patch intersection
    for the scalar constant t in:

        P                    + t * V                =  Q(u,w)
         (origin point in 3D)       (dir vector 3D)

    in terms of only:
       
          P            V            P                     and various scalars
           (origin) ,   (dir 3D) ,   (i,j) 0 <= i,j <= 3

    where:

                            T
    Q(u,w) = [U] [N] [B] [M]  [W]



               n  n-1  n-2   n-3
      [U] = [ u  u    u     u ....     u  1 ]      ( 0.0 <= u <= 1.0 )
               3  2
          = [ u  u  u 1 ]    ( in my particular case )


               n  n-1  n-2   n-3             T
      [W] = [ w  w    w     w ....     w  1 ]      ( 0.0 <= w <= 1.0 )

               3  2      T
          = [ w  w  w 1 ]    ( in my particular case )


                   T
      [ N ] = [ M ]   =  | -1  3 -3  1 |     ( for my particular case )
                         |  3 -6  3  0 |
                         | -3  3  0  0 |
                         |  1  0  0  0 |


      [ B ] =  | P       P       P       P      | (control points in 3D space)
               |  (0,0)   (0,1)   (0,2)   (0,3) |
               |                                |
               | P       P       P       P      |
               |  (1,0)   (1,1)   (1,2)   (1,3) |
               |                                |
               | P       P       P       P      |
               |  (2,0)   (2,1)   (2,2)   (2,3) |
               |                                |
               | P       P       P       P      |
               |  (3,0)   (3,1)   (3,2)   (3,3) |



                                        Thanx,
