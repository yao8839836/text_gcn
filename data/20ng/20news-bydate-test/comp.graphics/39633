I hope someone can help me with the following problem - I'm sure there
must be a known solution.

Given a rectangle defined by

-X <= x <= X  and -Y <= y <= Y  where X and Y are constant

and a parallelogram defined by

-C1 <= a*x + b*y <= C1  and -C2 <= c*x + d*y <= C2

where C1, C2, a, b, c, d are constants and b/a != d/c (i.e. not
parallel lines)                                ^^
                                          not equal to

what is the area of their intersection?

   What I'm after is some general algorithm suitable for ALL rectangles
and parallelograms that can be described by the above equations.  At the 
moment it looks like I'm going to have to look at all possible cases 
and examine each seperately e.g.

1) rectangle encloses parallelogram. 

2) parallelogram encloses rectangle.

3) two corners of parallelogram inside rectangle

                            \ /
                             "

4) two corners of parallelogram outside rectangle

   I hope someone can help.

Many thanks in advance,
