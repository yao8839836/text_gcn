Subject: Please Help: Point in concave Polyhedra
Lines: 43

Dear Netters:


I am looking for C source code to test if a 3D point lies within a

concave polyhadra. I have read a few articles about this and know

that two solutions exist: parity counting and angle sumation. Both


ideas are pretty simple but coding is not. So I wonder if there exists

public domain source code for this.

    Another 'rough' solition (don't care special cases) is ray-casting

which is reported to be more or less independent of number of faces

consisting the polyhedra if a special space indexing is used
(M. Tamminen, et. al., 1984. "Ray-casting and block model conversion
using a spatial index". Computer-Aided-Designs. 4, 1984, 60-65).
But the prerequirement is that all the facets of polyhedra have their
normal pointing outside of polyhedra. How this could be done in practice ?
I have a set of trangles consisting the polyhedra. How could I ensure their
normals pointing outside the polyhedra ? The paper mentioned above assumed
this is already the case.


   I have also read some standard computer graphics textbook about hidden
line removal. It says "if we make the rule that the normal of a facet pointing

toward viewer standing far away from the polyhedra...". Again how to make
sure ?


   Any pointers are welcome ?
