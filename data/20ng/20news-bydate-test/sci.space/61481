As Ben says - this re-boost idea is all news to us here.  Do you know 
something we don't?  Please supply a source - it would be nice for 
the schedulers of observations to know where the thing is going to 
be.  These altitude numbers are also way off.  

My best source has: 
"Minimum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is:    573 Kilometers"
"Maximum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is:    603 Kilometers"
"Delta   ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is:      3 Kilometers" 

(PMDB is Proposal Management Data Base - used to schedule observations.)

Could you supply some calculations?  You might check some recent 
postings that explained that 'a small booster' as suggested does 
not now exist, so comparing the mass of something that doesn't 
exist to the mass of the OMS fuel seems impossible.  The contamination 
threat also remains.

  Longer drag life I can understand, but could you explain the 
antenna pointing?

Tell me about it.  Although the arrays can be (and are) moved perfectly 
well utilizing the second electronics box.  Getting them both working 
is much desireable so as to reclaim redundancy.

I don't mean to jump on you - helpful suggestions are always welcome 
and we all know the more ideas the better, but I do want the true 
situation to be described clearly and correctly, lest some get 
confused.
