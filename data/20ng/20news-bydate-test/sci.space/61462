I'd guess this was a garbled report of the NERVA effort to develop a
solid-core fission rocket (the most mundane type of nuclear rocket).
That was the only advanced-propulsion project that was done on a large
enough scale to be likely to attract news attention.  It *could* be any
number of things -- the description given is awfully vague -- but I'd
put a small bet on NERVA.
