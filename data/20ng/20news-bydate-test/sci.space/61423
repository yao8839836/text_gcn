If we assume 6% inflation since 1969, that $25B would be worth about $100B
GD reckon a moon mission today could cost only $10B. Thats a factor of ten
reduction in cost. It might be possible to reduce that number futher by
using a few shortcuts ( Russian rockets?).   Asuming it gets built, I think
the Delta Clipper could very well achive the goal.
