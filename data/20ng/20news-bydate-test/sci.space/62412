it takes politics and PR to keep the bucks coming.

Yes this may be true in the case of the SCIENCE data coming from the spacecraft
and other stuff about the operations.  However, there is still stuff regarding

to keeping it theirs.  But this does not mean that everything can or
should be swept under the umbrella of company proprietory data.
