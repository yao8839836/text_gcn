My information shows that the last San Marco launch was 1988.  There seem to 
have been a total of seven before that.  I seem to recall that someone, either
ASI or the University of Rome (?) includes money in their annual budget for
maintainance of the platforms (there are actually two).

The Italians have been spending money to develop an advanced Scout.  However,
recent events in the Italian space program, and the Italian government overall
make me skeptical that this will get off the ground in the near future.
