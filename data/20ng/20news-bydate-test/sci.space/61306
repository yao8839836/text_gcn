If this facility is in Kaliningrad, this is not near Moscow,
it is in fact the ex-East Prussian Konigsberg, now a Russian
enclave on the Baltic coast.  It is served by ships and rail, 
and the intrepid traveller in Europe would find it accessible 
and might even want to try to arrange a tour (??).

P.S. I'm quite glad that a couple of people stated quite eloquently 
     the aesthetic/natural objections to the space billboard.
