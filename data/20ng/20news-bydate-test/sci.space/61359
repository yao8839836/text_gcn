Just a few contributions from the space program to "regular" society:

1.	Calculators
2.	Teflon (So your eggs don't stick in the pan)
3.	Pacemakers (Kept my grandfather alive from 1976 until 1988)


p.s.  To all the regular contributors to sci.space.news and
sci.space.shuttle, thanks for all your hard work keeping us informed
as to the doings down in NASA and other space-type agencies.  I don't
have much time to read USENET, but I ALWAYS read these two groups....
