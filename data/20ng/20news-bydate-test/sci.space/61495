We've been progressing towards that goal for 30 years now.  We precede
any orbiting mission with flyby missions.  Of course, it gets harder to
do as we work our way farther away from Earth.  We're just starting to
work out to the outer planets: Galileo will orbit Jupiter, and Cassini around 
Saturn.

Well first things first. We'll do a flyby mission first since it is
much easier and faster to do.  If the Fast Pluto Flyby mission is approved then
we'll launch a Pluto mission before the end of the decade.  A Pluto orbiter
however requires a larger spacecraft and a longer cruise period.   Orbit
insertion requires more fuel has to be carried along and restricts the
trajectory to a slower approach velocity to Pluto.
I'd imagine though that we would be doing a Neptune orbiting
mission before a Pluto orbiting mission, unless the Pluto flyby turns
up something really interesting.
