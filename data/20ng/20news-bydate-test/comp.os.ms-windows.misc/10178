I  _do_ know  that  IBM systems, the PS/2 56SLC2, in  particular, have
absolutely no  problem  with  OS/2--never had  a "random" crash  while
running any of  my programs under  OS/2.   In fact, I  don't  remember
_ever_ crashing.

Of course, I really don't run any  OS/2 programs, just the  same bunch
of DOS and Windows stuff that I've always been running.

And  when  I  had  the  56SLC  (this is  the  386SLC  system)  running
Dos/Windows, I had only  one crash, and it was consistent.   FTP had a
tendency  to  crash  whenever  I would  get  large  files (>1mb)  from
particularly fast  clients  (DTR's  150K-200K/sec), I  figured out the
problem was with smartdrv's write buffering--if I turned off the write
buffer, everything would work fine.

FTP under OS/2 has never locked,  though.  I can even format  floppies
(to use the most often cited example of the superiority of OS/2.)

Yeah, I guess I'm willing to admit that OS/2  is somewhat sensitive to
specific hardware.  WP51 for DOS works perfectly fine on my SLC2...

Well,  I save all  my  personal files to floppy,  and when  i did that
under Windows, a floppy save of a large file hung up the system.

I  also found  it quite bothersome to  have  to  continually tweak the
tasking options  on fractint for dos whenever I wanted to do a fractal
computation in the background.

The idea is  that OS/2's DOS sessions can see more memory than Windows
DOS  sessions.  I  let  XPL (a  shareware calculus program) see around
720KB of free _conventional_ memory, which lets me  do bigger symbolic
manipulations than is possible  under straight DOS (where it would see
around 610KB of conventional RAM.).  I  also found it really handy for
my _own_ DOS-based programs, which, without  any re-writing, could now
handle larger data sets, simulate for more iterations, etc. Of course,
the  point is  now moot,  since  the OS/2 programs I now write  simply
_never_ run into memory limitations.  I never programmed  for Windows,
so I don't have much of a comparison here, though....
