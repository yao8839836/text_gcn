I have a 486 sx 25 and I recently added a SCSI drive to my system using an  
Adaptec 1522 (non busmastering) controller. Yesterday I ran coretest to  
find out drive performance and these are the values I got

Seagate 106 Meg: 875.1kb/Sec	14.5ms avg seek   3.7ms track to track 
Quantum 400 Meg SCSI: 991.2 Kb/sec  12.7 avg seek 3.6 track to track.

First off all are these good results? I don't know what typical values  
are.

What I'm wondering now is the following. My swap file is currently on the  
IDE. I could move it to the SCSI which is 13% faster, but then I would not  
be able to use 32-bit access which might actuall make it slower. So on  
which drive should I put my swap file to get best results? Is there a swap  
file speed test program out there?

Finally, I also ran the above tests with the ASPI2DOS driver loaded and I  
got no difference whatsoever in performance. Is there any reason at all  
why I should load this driver?

Thanks in advance, I will post a summary if I get enough responses.
