It does sound funny, I will admit.  But for me it is true.  Windows crashed on
all of the time (and from what I have read in PC Mag, this is not the exception)
.  OS/2 gives each windows app a VDM and they can't touch each other or
(generally) anything they aren't supposed to have.  If windows works for you,
then great.  Maybe this is why some people don't see why OS/2 is the OS of 
choice.  If windows doesn't crash on you, and you don't mind waiting on each
task, and not being able to adress your memory better than DOS, some of the
key reasons for using OS/2 are gone.  I probably  would still use it, but it
would be more of an even fight.
