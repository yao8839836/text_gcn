Lotus Organizer!!!  Quick, cheap, pretty!  And has all of those features 
you want ...

You might look at one of the shell alternatives provided by third
parties.  Norton Desktop for Windows, for instance.

Personally, I *like* File Manager, which comes with Windows.  It's much
faster than NDW's, and the File Manager that's part of Windows for
Workgroups even has a decent button bar.

That first you can do with File Manager, but the others you'll need
to look at NDW or PC Tools for Windows, etc.

I haven't yet seen a decent freeware or even shareware shell.  But
it may be just me.
