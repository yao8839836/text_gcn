Using a Windows 3.1 printer driver, I would like to "print to a file", with
output as a Postscript file.  Later, I would like to take this Postscript file
to a machine with an attached Hewlett Packard 4M laser printer, and print the
document at 600 dots per inch resolution.

I would like to use this method to print from WordPerfect For Windows, and from
an image processing program that can output images in Postscript.

Here's the problem:  the Windows Postscript printer driver (pscript.drv)
doesn't allow me to specify 600 dpi.  In fact, the setup dialog for this driver
does have a pull-down menu for "resolution", but the only choice given in the
menu is 300!  Not a really useful menu.

Any ideas?
