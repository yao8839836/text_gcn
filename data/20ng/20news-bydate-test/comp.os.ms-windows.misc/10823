Many thanks to those who responded to my question.  Unfortunately I have
had no luck in actually getting such a font, and a lot of people interested
in geting one, and so I have decided to create my own truetype font fitting 
that description.  This font is based on that used in the 1904 issue of 
Dineen's dictionary and is typical of that found in Irish books from the 
early part of the century.  This may take me some time to do (in my
limited spare time) but I'll make it available to anyone who is interested, 
when it is ready.

The responses I received are summerised below:

Kevin Donnelly (caoimhin@smo.ac.uk) mentioned that Michael Everson
(everson@irlearn.ucd.ie) had developed some Clo/ Gaelach fonts
for the Macintosh and may be able to advise me.  I contacted Michael
and he told me that he has three fonts available for the Macintosh, and
that he will eventually port them to the PC, but that he will be charging 
IR 100 (about $160) for each one.

pbryant@ukelele.GCR.COM mentioned that he uses two font that have a
'nice Irish/Gaelic look to them'.  These are "Durrow" and "American 
Uncial-Normal".  I don't know where you can get these but I don't
think that they have the effects I am looking for.

Finally, rhiannon@netcom.com (Rhia) mentioned that the "Meath" font
included in the Casady & Greene Fluent Laser Fonts 2 package
is very much like what I was describing.  I faxed Casady & Greene for
info but got no reply.

So that's it.  I'll post these newsgroups when I make my font available.

Colum Twomey.
