	WinZip 4.0 (ftp.cica.indiana.edu:pub/pc/win3/(util?) ). It is
a shell (it DOES call DOS ), but a very, very good one. It will also
do arc, arj and lzh. It fully supports PKZIP 2.04 . Try using it...
It might be a shell --very unobtrusive--, but that also means you dont
need to update it with every every-other-letter-of-the-alphabet version
of PKZIP... :)
Hope it helps....
