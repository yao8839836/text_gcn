I've had the same problem with a Maxtor 7213A.  Turned off
smartdrive, 32 bit disk access, etc.  This same disk aborts
Norton Speed Disk (NU 4.5), up to 8 times, requesting NDD to be
run when attempting to defrag drive.  At Some peoples' suggestion
I reformatted my drive and reloaded DOS 5.0, Win 3.1 from
scratch.  A few people found that installing 3.1 on top of 3.1
beta on top of 3.0 caused a similar problem, So I tried this
drastic solution.  When the problem reoccurred, I didn't have the
brains not to load 6.0 and dblespaced the drive.

I get arround the annoyance by copying my *.grp files to *.gro.
when I get the message, I run file manager and copy the
offeniding group files from *.gro ove rthe *.grp.  Then I quit
and restart windows(If the group is an often used important one.)

This really sucks.  But I'm pretty sure that the problem is the
drive (especially with the NSD problem).  I will be going with
out over 66% of my memory after finals for 2 to 4 weeks, while
the guy I bought the disk and system from, goes over it and
either fixes it or replaces the drive.  I can't wait to have a
system that will run consistently with all hte goodies!
