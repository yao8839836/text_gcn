   After hearing endless debate (READ: name-calling) over which os is better, dos
   and windows or OS/2 and finally having enought resourses to play with a couple
   of different operating systems, I have decided to put the two products to a
   head to head test, as so many fellow newsposters have suggested.  I have, 
   however, no desire whatsoever to use a version of os/2 which wont REALLY
   do what it says (i.e. run windows apps)  OS/2 2.0-2.1 will not run windows
   apps in 386 enhansed mode, something that most larger windows apps require, but
   OS/2 2.2, which is supposed to be in beta test, is supposed to.  I have heard
   that os/2 2.2 beta is available via ftp, and I was wondering if anyone knew
   where to obtain a copy.  I would appreciate any information, as I would like, 
   once and for all, to establish for myself which is the best os for my needs.

If you wait until May the 18th you will be able to buy the new OS/2
2.1 since it will be released at Comdex that day. It will run Windows
3.1 apps and Windows enh. mode. If you can't wait, then you can ftp a
6 months old beta version from ftp-os2.nmsu.edu, but this version is
probably a lot slower than the final product.

When you do your test, please have in mind that a single tasking
system will always be faster at doing one task. The real power of OS2
lies in the multitasking and can't really be measured by a stopwatch.

Happy benchmarking.
