Like it or not stock prices and sales of a particular product ARE measures
of success. They can be measures of short term or long term success. I think
in MS case they are a good measure of their long term success. The original
post mentioned how it seems on this group that there are a large number
of people attacking MS and not willing to accept anything positive about MS.
I was trying to make a point that the attacks are over emphasized and to
look at the sales of MS products they definitely tell a different story.

I also think a large number of the attackers or debaters as you call
them are highly technical. Look around in the real world people don't want
to GREP and AUCK and ls -l they just want to push the buttons and get their 
job done on a reasonably priced piece of hardware that does not need 
a computer smart guy to load configure etc etc. Like it or not MS and the
multitudes of business applications that exist to run under Windows does
this and does it WELL. We are running 150 pc's loaded with a complete
suite of mostly MS Windows applications in an administrative business
function on a Novell network running all software off the server.
It does the job quite well and if we had it to do over again we would pick
Windows again. 
Again I repeat to MS keep doing what you are doing. You are doing a great
job.
Flame on
