On a recently acquired Gateway 2000 machine, when starting Windows,
three copyright statements flash on the screen right after the MS logo
disappears and before ProgramManager takes over.  This does not happen
on any other of our machines, and I am wondering whether this is a
feature or whether this is related to several problems we are having
with the machine.

The system is a Gateway 2000, 4DX-33 machine.

The messages that appear are:

	(c) Copyright 1985-1992 Congruent Corporation
		All Rights Reserved
	(c) Copyright 1985-1992 Microsoft Corporation
		All Rights Reserved

The AUTOEXEC.BAT file looks like this:

@ECHO OFF
PROMPT $P$G
SET MOUSE=C:\MSMOUSE
C:\MSMOUSE\MOUSE
PATH=C:\;C:\DOS;C:\WINDOWS;c:\123;c:\wp51;f:\apps;f:\system;f:\winapps;f:\public
SET TEMP=C:\WINDOWS\TEMP
lh wd8003e -n 0x62 5 0x280 0xd000
lh winpkt 0x60 0x62
lh ipx
lh netx
f:\login\login
win :

The CONFIG.SYS file looks like this:

DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\HIMEM.SYS
DOS=HIGH,umb
DEVICE=C:\WINDOWS\EMM386.EXE NOEMS X=D000-D1FF
STACKS=9,256
FILES=50
BUFFERS=30
SHELL=C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM /P /E:1024

Does anyone know what is going on?  Any help would be much
appreciated.
