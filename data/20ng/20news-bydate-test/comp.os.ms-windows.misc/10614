I have a problem with the wallpaper on my desktop, in 1024x768x256 mode.  
For bitmap files bigger than about 512k (slightly less sometimes depending 
on the exact dimensions), the wallpaper display is badly corrupted.  The 
rest of the desktop is fine.  For wallpaper bitmaps smaller than this, I 
have no problem.  I have a friend who has an 800k bitmap which he has no 
problems with, so it is possible.  It is also possible to display these
bitmaps using CShow in 1024x768x256 mode with no problem, so the video 
card is not at fault.

How can I remedy this?

My system:

     386DX40, 4Mb ram.
     DOS 6.0, Windows 3.1.
     Oak 1Mb 077 Video card, 1024x768x256 mode, using supplied drivers.
     Windows has a permanent 11,288kb swap file.

Please reply via e-mail, and _use the address in my .sig_, as our post 
software always seems to mangle the address in the header.

    Thanks,
          Mazz.
