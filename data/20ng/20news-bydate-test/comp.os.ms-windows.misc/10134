Lets see... what MS products don't have major bugs in them?  Oh, but
the fifth release the bugs are generally cleared up, even if their
customers must buy new "releases" from them that are little more than
bug fixes.  Anyone who buys a $2500 computer system and then runs MS
Windows on it is in desperate need of sympathy.  

Oh wait! MS innovated the plastic housing on the MS mouse---didn't
they?  "Logitech Inside"

You can't even really call it secondary creativity when a company
gathers together a bunch of knock-off packages and peddles them to
neophytes.  If MS does anything, it appears someone has to do it
first.  It appears that MS is finding out that throwing money at
technological problems is by no means a guaranteed solution.
