On my PC I almost exclusively run windows. The only dos based application  
I have is ProcommPlus.  In my config.sys I have emm386 loaded with the  
option noems (no expanded memory). Following a thread in one of the comp  
newsgroups, I read that it was no necessary to have emm386 loaded. Indeed,  
in the manual, it says that emm386 is used to get expanded memory out of  
extended memory. Since I have the noems option, it seems to me that the  
emm386 device is useless in my case. 

Should I use emm386 or should I remove it from my config.sys?

Thanks for your help,

-Eric
