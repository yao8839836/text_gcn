There was a post about something similar a while back.  It seems windows
does *not* take it upon itself to free up any sys. resources an
applllication is using when that application is done.  That job is left
entirely to the application.  that is, the application has to clean up
after itself when it quits.

Anyone out there know if there is a utility for windows which  will
clean up sys. resources when an application quits (mother.zip???).

peace,
Mickey
