    Hi,
      I've been using Plannet Crafter's "Plug-in" for Program Manager.
      Its listed in most BBS'es as PLUGIN13.  Its an add-on which gives
      some needed features to Progman; such as the ability to better
      manage your groups, change your cursor and icons on the fly,
      constant status of RAM and resources, "Quick-menu" (a drop-down
      menu of DOS commands or app launcher), plus some other neat stuff.
      Used it, liked it, and even reg'd it <G>.

      If you can't find it anywhere, let me know and I'll zip it up and
      mail it to you (shareware version, of course <g>...)

Aloha...
