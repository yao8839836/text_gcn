This pretty much confirms my original impression after reading
through the documentation on dos-6.  The double space sounds nice,
but NOT on your primary disk!!  I'll probably wind up making a
disk partition d: and doublespacing *it*, using it as an archive.
Probably would be useful on floppy disks as well.  But on c:?  Uh, uh...

[I particularly disliked the note that said something like "double
space is irreversible"].
