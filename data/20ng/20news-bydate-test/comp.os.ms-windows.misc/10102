Source for "does not" comment: the CD-ROM and manuals for the March beta
-- there *is* no X windows server there.

Will there be?  Of course.  (Even) if Microsoft supplies one with NT,
other vendors will no doubt port their's to NT.

According to a recent newsletter from Hummingbird Communications Ltd.,
they announced eXceede/NT at UNIFORUM 93.  The announcement reads like it
is "here now", but there is no order or price info.  I would guess it
must be RSN.  There is a dev kit too.
