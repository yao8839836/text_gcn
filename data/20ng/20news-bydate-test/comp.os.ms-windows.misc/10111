One of our users is having an unusual problem.  If she does an Alt/Tab to
a full-screen DOS program, when she goes back to Windows her desktop fonts
have changed.  If she goes back to a full-screen DOS program and then goes
back to Windows, the font has changed back to its default font.  It's not
a major problem (everything works and the font is legible), but it is
annoying.  Does anyone have any idea why this happens.  By the way, she
has a DEC 486D2LP machine.
