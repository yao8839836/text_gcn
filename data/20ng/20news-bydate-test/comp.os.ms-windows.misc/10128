- They invented the "how to make money on others ideas".
- They made money.
- They weren't in the air at the wrong time...

Admit it BillG is a damn smart guy. How many out there can make money on 
almost useless products...Useless even if you look at the time Dos were 
written..it stinked already then..

If I could choose one marketing guy in the world, I think I would choose 
him. He's so good that almost everyone hates him, but they still use his 
stuff...
