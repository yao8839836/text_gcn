Subject: Hot-key for switching to the Program Manager?
Organization: Communication Systems, Lund Institute of Technology, Sweden
Lines: 10

In Win 3.1, one may assign hot-keys for the program items within the
Program Manager. How about the Program Manager itself? Is there one
already, or is there some way to assign one?

Regards,
