It's interesting to see how the greatest vapour-project of the world
has not been able to make much of a difference here :-)

Before you think it's a interesting rag, they have this incredibly
incompetent article/opinion piece by someone named Robert Ziff which
has preposturous statements like "Sun has sold around 300
multiprocessing servers"!!!!!!  (In that case USC has around 4% of all
Sun MP servers on earth :-)) He is off by a factor of 50? 100?  
I thought of sending them a "factual disaster" email message; they have
a column titled "how to contact us" but being silly PCheads they seem
to have never heard of the Internet.
