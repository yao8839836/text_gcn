Hiyas ALL,

Upon getting Animated Desktop for Windows as a gift from my boyfriend, I 
couldn't wait to install it. I had gotten an advertisement for it and put 
it aside 
with my list of 'I Wants.' After installing the software, it didn't load. 
No part of 
the software would load even though the install went seemingly well.

	I called Deltapoint with the problem and after asking me twenty 
million different questions about my system.. concluded that I had one of 
the 
systems that the software was 'incompatible with'. Of course they're 
willing to 
give me my $$$ back.. What a waste of time and energy.  The folks on their 
support line, although nice, are extremely ignorant regarding the workings 
of 
Windows 3.1. 
	After my experience with the installation of the SB 16, I  learned 
some of the function of windows dll files. Before sending back Desktop 
Animator,  decided to do some fooling around with the different versions of 

.dll files I had. I had 2 versions of cpalette.dll one dated 8/92 and > 
100K the 
other dated 1/93 and smaller (the 1/93 smaller version was the one supplied 

with Desktop Animator). I moved the bigger, older version of cpalette.dll  
to a 
directory outside my path. (For some reason, I had the older Cpalette.dll 
in my 
Windows directory and the newer cpallette in my windows\system directory.) 
When I did this, the animator's editor loaded.. and so did 2 other of the 
applications in the package.. the main application still didn't load. Does 
anyone have any ideas as to why this would occur or any further suggestions 

for trouble-shooting?
