Subject: Problem on DOS box from Windows - "this file is compressed..."

I've started getting a message from Windows 3.1 whenever I try to execute
a DOS program from Windows, either thru the Program Manager or the File
Manager. A message box comes up and says "This program or one of its
components is compressed. Use the MS-DOS expand command to expand the
file."

Now, I know this is bogus, because I can always execute the program
from DOS when not running windows. The program in question is COMMAND.COM
(yup, the basic DOS command line shell...) And, the expand command tells
me that the file is already expanded.

All my windows apps work just fine - I only get this message when trying
to execute a DOS program from Windows.

Clues anyone?  Thanks!!   Christopher Wroten, cfw@world.std.com
