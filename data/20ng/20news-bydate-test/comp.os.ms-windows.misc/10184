	I'm working at a workstation which is usually attached to a Novell
network (using shell version 3.22, I think). The workstation, a 386, was set
up to run Windows 3.0 with the network about a year ago. Needless to say,
I'd like to upgrade it to Windows 3.1, and have it work with the network.

	Basically, the Windows files'd be on the local hard drive, but
several DOS applications, like Word Perfect, will be on the network. I'd
mainly want Windows to access the network drives, the network printers, and
perhaps handle some network functions as well. If I could multitask the DOS
apps whose executables are on the network, that'd be great, but I could live
without it.

	Eventually, I'd like to get a few other 486s in the office working
with the network and Windows 3.1 as well. (However, most of the terminals
are 286s, which leaves the network pretty much DOS-bound, and I guess that
leaves out Windows for Workgroups.) And in the future, maybe there'd be
Norton desktop, but that's gettingahead of myself.

	As you can guess, I've never done anything like this before. I've
read through the networks material that came with Windows, but still, I'd
like to know if anyone out there has any experience in such an area.

	Please reply by Email. I don't scan these newsgroups often.

	Thanks for any replies.
