I have just added a Panasonic KP-X1123 24pin dot matrix printer to a 386sx/25. I installed
the appropriate Windows 3.1 printer driver (i.e. one specifically for this printer) but I'm
unable to persuade the poxy thing to print correctly. 
 
What appears to be happening is that the TrueType fonts don't get printed properly. My
experiments show that all graphic images (for example a line drawing from Corel Draw) print
ok. GraphicsWorkshop for Windows happily prints GIFs etc. MS Notepad and MS Write will
print correctly providing the font's in the text are printer fonts. 
 
When I print TrueType fonts, some lines appear to be printed in the wrong order. If I change 
the text font to a printer font, the problem is eliminated.
 
I have tried using printer drivers for printers which the KX-P1123 (snappy name) emulates,
namely Epsom LQ-850 and IBM ProPrinter X24 and the same problem occurs.
 
If there is some kind soul who can tell me just what the hell is going on, I would be most 
chuffed.
