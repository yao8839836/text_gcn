Well, I thought that highmem.sys would do that too. I just took out emm386  
of my config.sys, and I'm still loading my other drivers high (mouse, vga  
shadow bios, dos-key etc.) I haven't checked mem/c, but I believe I have  
managed to load them high (ie between 640KB and 1024KB).

Also, ever since I took out emm386, windows loads slightly faster, I get  
about 3 extra meg of freemem in windows (I'm running 386 enhanced with 4  
Meg RAM, 7 Meg swap) and I got rid of my ctrl-alt del reboot problem  
(before, the computer would not reboot using ctrl-alt-del after exiting  
windows). 

I would really like to keep emm386 out of my config.sys. Anybody else have  
info on this???
