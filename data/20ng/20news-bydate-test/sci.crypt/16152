I don't think they can do that without changing the law.  The chip itself
isn't classified, and reverse engineering is allowed by law (possibly)
unless prohibited by a valid contract.  The algorithm may be classified,
but there are many court cases ruling that information identical to
classfied information, but obtained from unclassified sources, is freely
publishable (with the possible exception of nuclear weapon information.)
