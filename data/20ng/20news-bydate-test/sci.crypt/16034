	You have underlined here the battle that must be fought.  It is
	a battle for the "hearts and minds" of the american public.
	People must realize that the government is not their a fit
	"father confessor".  The government does not have a right to
	share our every thought the moment we decide to share that
	thought with someone else at a distance.  In order to protect
	ourselves from a government bent on undermining the constitution
	we must realize that our government is our enemy as much if not
	more than the Soviet Union ever was.  This is hard for 
	some people who have been brought up with loyalty to our government
	cast as being synonmous with patriotism.

	We must be vigilant and make sure that we do not let such
	events go by unprotested.  We must be willing to fight the
	government at every step of the way.

	Its time we rolled back this nonsense.  Civil forfeiture is
	the most effective end run around the constitution that has
	ever been promulgated.  Our enemy used to be the Soviets now
	it is clearly our own government.
