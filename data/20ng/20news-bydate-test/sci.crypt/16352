Wouldn't this method be vulnerable against a "birthday" attack?
Currently a cracker needs to find the _only_ (*1) key that produces
the given ciphertext.  He has to try about 2^63 keys on the average.
In the proposed method the cracker only needs _any pair_ of key halves.
If he can store about 2^32 guesses for one half, he is likely to find
a mathching pair in about 2^32 guesses.  (Here I have assumed that the
DES-encryption is reversable, if the key is guessed.  Is this so or do
the modifications of the S-boxes by the salt bits make it non-reversable?)

*1 Probably there is only one key; I think there is 1 chance in about 128
that there are two or more keys (can anyone verify this?), but this doesn't
help the cracker much.
