Yes -- great chapter.  Elizabeth Friedman (sp?) comes shining through.

However, the chapter also notes that these rum runners invented their own
crypto -- hired ex-military folks, in fact.  (How's that for a revolving
door?)

Now, given that today's rum runners (coke runners, actually) have even more
money than yesterday's, it's reasonable to expect them to have even better
cryptography.  I doubt they have a chip foundry of their own yet, but ....

So, my question of the FBI/NIST/NSA is: "How are you going to make the rum
runners use the Clipper Chip?"

Answer:  	you're not.

Question:	OK -- in that case, your justification for taking away our
		rights has evaporated.  How do you justify our loss of rights
		if you can't use the drug dealers and terrorists?
