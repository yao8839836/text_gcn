There are other laws and directives which bear upon the subject.  For
example, the National Computer Security Act of 1987 specifically directs
NBS [sic] to work with NSA on developing security standards for civilian
Federal computers.  (Pick up the bill from cpsr.org; it also includes
a report describing it, and some of the legislative history, including
concerns about NSA's involvement.)  Note also that NSA is specifically
charged with running the National Computer Security Center,  -- to
quote the aforementioned report -- ``NSA also will work with industries at
the DOD Computer Security Center to develop security standards for private
sector use.''

It may or may not be a good idea to have NSA tinkering with this, but
I'm pretty sure it's legal.  (Btw -- when it comes to development of
cryptosystems, there may be two choices.  Either NSA helped develop it,
in which case maybe they can crack it, maybe not, but probably, no one
else can; or NSA didn't help, in which case they probably can crack it,
and maybe others as well...)
