OK Steve, here's a sketch of an alternative that I believe addresses
most of the objections to the Clipper scheme.

Notation:
	+	concatenation
	^	exclusive or
	E(M,K)	message M encrypted by key K
	D(M,K)	message M decrypted by key K
	H(M)	hash (digest/signature) of message M

Important Values:
	U0[X]		local chip unit key from escrow agency X
	U1[X]		remote chip unit key from escrow agency X
	N[0]		serial number of the local chip
	N[1]		serial number of the remote chip
	A		number of escrow agencies
	K[0],K[1]	"session keys" agreed upon external to this protocol
	F		"family key", need not be secret

Protocol:
	Choose K0[1],...K0[A] such that K[0] = K0[1]^...^K0[A]
	Remote chip does same for K[1],K1[1],...,K1[A].

	Compute the following:

		L0[1] = E(K0[1], U0[1])
		...
		L0[A] = E(K0[A], U0[A])

		L[0] = N[0] + E(N[0] + L0[1] + ... + L0[A], F)

		Remote chip does the same for L1[1],...,L1[A],L[1]

	Send L[0] to remote chip and receive L[1] from remote chip

	Compute:

		KE[0] = H(K[0] + N[0] + L0[1] + ... + L0[A]
			+ K[1] + D(L[1], F)

		KD[0] = H(K[1] + D(L[1], F)
			+ K[0] + N[0] + L0[1] + ... + L0[A]

		Note that D(L[1], F) = N[1] + L1[1] + ... + L1[A]

		Remote chip does the same for KE[1] and KD[1]

	User data is encrypted (decrypted) with keys KE[0], KE[1]
		(KD[0], KD[1])

Assumptions:
	No trap doors in E(), D() and H(). H() is not invertible.

	Algorithms for E(), D() and H() are secret. Otherwise a software
	implementation (bogus chip) could communicate with a real chip.

	The chip only supports the following operation:

		1)  Return N[0]
		2)  Load K0[x]
		3)  Return E(K0[x], U0[x])
		4)  Return E(N[0] + L0[1] + ... + L0[A], F)
		5)  Given E(N[1] + L1[1] + ... + L1[A], F),
			return N[1],L1[1],...,L1[A]
		6)  Load K[1]
		7)  Given E(N[1] + L1[1] + ... + L1[A], F),
			compute KE[0], KD[0]
		8)  Given M, return E(M, KE[0])
		9)  Given M, return D(M, KD[0])

	Anything programmed into the chip can be determined by destroying
	the chip (U[1],...,U[A],F,N[0]).

	U[1],...,U[A] can not be determined except by destroying the chip.
	(Unfortunately this may not be true in reality. I suppose it's
	possible to determine how a chip has been programmed with a
	sophisticated[sp?] x-ray machine to look for blown fuses.)

	The U's are programmed independantly by the escrow agencies.

Notes:
	For tapping escrow agency Y is given N[0], E(K0[Y], U0[Y]), N[1],
	E(K1[Y], U1[Y]) and returns K0[Y], K1[Y].

	LEA's must contact all escrow agencies with the serial numbers from
	both chips and the encrypted partial keys. This allows the agencies
	to record that both chips were tapped.

	LEA's only get the session key, not the key to all conversations
	of a particular chip. This precludes real-time decrypting of a
	conversation but that isn't one of the STATED requirements.

Observation:
	In order for any secure by "tap-able" communication scheme to work,
	the active parts need to share a secret. And if this secret is
	revealed, communications by those that know the secret can be made
	"un-tap-able". Obvious candidates are the cryptographic algorithm
	and the master (family) key. Relative size and complexity suggests
	that the key can be obtained from a silicon implementation of the
	scheme a LOT easier and faster than the algorithm.
