OK, Andrew, I'll provide some evidence. A friend of mine worked for an
electronics manufacturer on with a west-coast office. They routinely sold
equipment to the Japanese. One day, the Japanese started showing up with
discount demands that were amazingly close to the cost to manufacture the
products.

This company routinely sent most of the manufacturing data to the field 
offices. The Japanese had simply intercepted it. So my friend, the computer
systems admin, came up with a solution. He started sending the data out
double-block-encrypted with DES. 

Two days after this new distribution plan was implemented, the president of
the company got a visit from a pair of government agents. They told him to
"knock it off". The president gave in, since his company did a considerable
business with the federal government.

Now, if the government wasn't monitoring the communications, how would they
even know that the encryption system was installed? Further, since encryp-
tion isn't illegal, and DES certainly isn't, what is the basis of the
government's cease-and-desist demand?

The spooks do whatever they think is necessary, with or without the blessings
of the law. I'll say "no thanks" to Clipper, or anything else the government
produces. For the moment, double or triple DES is probably adequate. And when
the line is idle, send random garbage, just to keep 'em busy.
