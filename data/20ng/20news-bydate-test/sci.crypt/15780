It is said that CELP vocoders can run on the highest speed 486s with
some room to spare -- they turn 64kbit (8 bit samples, 8k samples/sec)
into 4800 baud. However, DSP is hairy, and I have yet to see actual
proof of this in the form of an implementation. I have heard fairly
reliable rumors to the effect that a famous internetworking guru has a
CELP implementation that runs on Sparcstation 1+'s with some room to
spare, but I have not succeeded thus far in getting my hands on a copy
-- the guru in question has a reputation for not releasing code
without having beaten on it for a very very long time first. 

DSP experts are heavily encouraged to try their own hand at this
problem.
