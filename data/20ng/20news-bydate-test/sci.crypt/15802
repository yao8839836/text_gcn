Now, almost 100 years later, we have the right words for the problem here.

Phone calls are "virtual visits".  Those experienced in virtual reality
would know from that title that phone calls need to have all the properties
of a walk in the park with your friend -- security from casual overhearing
and easy verification to see if anyone is listening secretively.  As designed,
they fail at that.

..trouble is, telephones were invented a long time ago and people didn't
realize the danger or the concept of virtual reality back then.
