Gentlefolk,

        It seems to me that the "Step 1" of taking a warrant to the
        telco to get a wiretap is so much stinky red herring (don't
        you love animal metaphors).

        With each phone broadcasting the serial number of its chip
        ("E(N;F)" is not syntactically different than "N"), all they
        have to do is aim a reciever in the general direction of
        today's target and use the serial number to identify the
        session they want, and get the chip number of the other end of
        the conversation. Even without the key, this is great for
        traffic analysis. I can think of several ways to learn the
        right serial number.

        It looks like one intended effect of the Clipper is to
        eliminate the awkward business of getting the telco to
        cooperate (or risking getting caught in the act with your
        alligator clips erect). This is particularly handy if you have
        S1 and S2.

        BTW, did anyone explain why they are scrambling the serial
        number?
        
        Cheers,
                Marc
