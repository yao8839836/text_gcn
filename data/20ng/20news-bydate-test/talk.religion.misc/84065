  Your information on this topic is very much out of date.  Quantum Electro-
dynamics (QED - which considers light to be particles) has been experimentally
verified to about 14 decimal digits of precision under ALL tested conditions.
I'm afraid that this case, at least in the physics community, has been decided.
Laymen should consult "QED - The Strange Theory of Light and Matter" by Richard
P. Feynman and for the more technically minded there's "The Feynman Lectures on
Physics" by Feynman, Leighton and Sands (an excellent 3 volumes).  Case closed.
