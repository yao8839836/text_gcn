   As opposed to Universal or Catholic or "FourSquare Gosple". I think that
   the Greek Orthodox Church would take high offense at your misuse of the
   word. Your version of Christianity is neither mainstream nor bible derived
   you make claims of bible-centricity that are not derivable soley from the
   Bible.  About six-seven months ago, you claimed that your primary objection
   to the LDS was that "our" doctrine was not bible-derived, And now this
   (and other) claims can be shown, are also not bible interpeting bible.

	Simple truths... oh for example?

       "paradise exalted to heaven"

	paradise wasn't equal to heaven and _now_ it is? Yet you claim that
 	peeple can not be exalted to heaven, nicht wahr?

	When I read the story, I found that  "Abraham's Bosom" wasn't so much
	a place, but somewhere the rich man could see and talk to Abraham?

	Gee this is fairly close to what the LDS call spirit prison, and what
        you have called false doctrine...

   This part is _not_ supported from scripture, nor does it support your
   claim that the "paradise" where Christ descended was exalted.

   Making such claims on this little "evidence" ignores the witness of the
   scripture
>
||Sun||Ephas:
||Sun|| 4:8 Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity
||Sun|| captive, and gave gifts unto men.
||Sun|| 
||Sun|| (X-REF Psalms 68:18)
||Sun||  Thou has ascended on hight, thout hast led captivity captive; thou has
||Sun||  recieved gifts for men; yea for the rebellious aslo, that the LORD God
||Sun||  might dwell amoung them
||Sun||
||Sun||Ephas:
||Sun|| 4:9 (Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first
||Sun|| into the lower parts of the earth?  4:10 He that descended is the same
||Sun|| also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all

||Sun|| some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; 4:12 For the

||Sun|| edifying of the body of Christ: 4:13 Till we all come in the unity of

||Sun|| unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ: 4:14 That we

||Sun|| truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head,

   Using this to argue that paradise or spirit prison, is now changed from
   a Pre-Easter postion to post-easter by God postion is not supportable.
 
   Makeing such a claim requires more evidence than you have given here...

  Yes, and your reasons are in general not supported by any direct reading
  of the scriptures. You have demonstrated that you claims to scriptural 
  "proof" need to be cross-checked. The referencs that you supply often do
  not support your postion, if they are read in the context of the scripture.

	How about that those who have been in paradise, and have accepted
	the gosple will be judged of Jesus Christ, and then return to the
	presence of God. Is that somehow different from your expressed view
	that the paradise spoken of (or "Abraham's Bosom")
