I'm for the moment interested in this notion of the 'leap of faith'
established by Kierkegaard. It clearly points out a possible solution
to transcendental values. What I don't understand is that it also
clearly shows the existentialism system where any leap to any
transcendental direction is equal. 

In other words I might not jump off the cliff mentioned above,
but at the same time I will decide to what direction I will go.
Actually I will do it just now.

Cheers,
Kent
