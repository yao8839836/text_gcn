Are you serious?!!!  Here's an exercise next time you are in the barnyard. 
Take *your* model and hold it directly above a fresh cowpie.  Then release the
model.  You will observe that on its own *your* model will assume a trajectory
earthward and come to rest exactly where it belongs.  Watch out for splatters,
particularly if you are wearing shorts when you perform this experiment.
