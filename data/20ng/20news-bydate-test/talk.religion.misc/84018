Other than it tells quite a lot about the Man himself.

Are you the spokesman for "most people?"

That you don't recognize the Biblical commentary used.  Those in the
church know the language though, and have no such excuse.

You missed the point -- which is that the Prophets, the Psalms, and 
Revelation, all together, provide a very rich view of a very special
event -- a wedding.

How are you able to make such a conclusion?  Please note, that the
first part of Revelation makes it clear that the address is to those
in the church. That said, it doesn't hurt to try to see what the 
prophecies are ahead of time -- for those outside the church.

So you say. It should be interesting to see what the investigators 
conclude, and what the final judgments are.

So much for war and government eh.

Very glad you asked, since I goofed -- it should be Philippian 1:14-19: 
(here from NIV)

	Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord
	have been encouraged to speak the word of God more
	courageously and fearlessly.

	It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and 
	rivalry, but others out of good will. The latter do so
	in love, knowing that I am put here for the gospel. 
	The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not
	sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for
	me while I am chains. But what does it matter? 

	The important thing is that in every way, whether from
	false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because
	of this I rejoice.
	
My comment stems from the realization that we who love the Lord, are
human and imperfect. Whatever we "preach," no matter how eloquent, or
how corrupted -- is of little difference. Those who know the Master's
voice will recognize Him -- a gem-stone amidst rock. Such is also the 
lesson of the "stumblingblock." For those who have an ear to hear.
