(sic) Oh, you're really bright. As if nobody would have understood it was a
typo.

Several parents with children who either had at one time or currently were
inside the compound made the aforementioned charges. One parent actually

Koresh on the phone.

You missed my point entirely.

is sociopathic behavior. It's not an oxymoron to have a GROUP of
SOCIOPATHS. I guess you're NOT a psychologist. Oh well...
