  I am not a paranoid, nor a government toady, nor even am I the guy you were
talking to originally, but I think you are simply NOT PAYING ATTENTION.

  A bunch of people living off by themselves with a lot of guns nearby is not
that wierd in Texas.  My own family, very quiet taxpayers with extremely con-
ventional views, has something like 10 rifles and shotguns in a two-person
home.  Some of them were mine, but I don't live there anymore.  I now have
my own shotgun in my apartment.

  Texas Child Protective Services (which loves to find child abuse) found no,
I repeat NO, evidence of abuse when they first looked at the BD, and is saying
that they see none in any of the kids who were released.  There is no evidence
that Koresh was banging anyone but his wives.

  It is not against the law to stockpile (most) weapons or campbell's soup.  
Nor is there any hard evidence in the form of actual hardware (as I write this)
to prove the BD really had any *proscribed* weapons.

  I feel they were all loonies, but there is no indication that they ever 
bothered anyone.  They were gone after in the wrong ways for the wrong reasons,
and the BATF and FBI who are so busy trumpeting this child abuse angle hasn't
got a leg to stand on or any right to be involved in such abuse cases anyway. 
If there was any real danger of the BD's going out on a rampage, then that
is up to the officers of the state of Texas, who are probably getting a per-
verse bit of pleasure at getting to torque the Feds for fucking up something
in their state.
