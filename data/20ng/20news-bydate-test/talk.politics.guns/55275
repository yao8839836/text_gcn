	This is laughable.  Licenses?  Right.  So then I would need a
	license to possess chlorine gas?  It is a weapons grade poison.
	Would I be breaking the law then if I were to, say, pour Chlorox
	on the spot where my cat pissed on the floor?  The reaction of
	ammonia and bleach liberates pure chlorine gas.  Do I go to jail
	for this?  Why or why not?

	Would I need a license to possess other chemical agents?  What about
	nicotine?  Deadly poison, and rather fast acting.  Must I now become
	licensed to posess tobacco?  And what about nicotine sulphate, an even
	deadlier poison?  Will I need a license to possess this type of 
	insecticide?  What about Raid(tm)?  Black Flag?  Gasoline?  Benzene?
	Hydrazine (a violent poison)?

	Will I go to jail for possessing a can of tomatoes that went bad with
	botulinus?

	What about my mom & pop QC lab where I use cyanogen bromide (mustard
	gas) to do lot analysis on certain non-prescription pharmaceuticals?

	What if I wish to use potassium cyanide to recover gold from aqua
	regia?  A license? 

	Would I need a license to possess Beryllium, perhaps the most poisonous
	non-radioactive metal?  How about Beryllium-Copper alloy?

	Do I need a license for nitrate fertilizers which *could* be used to
	make VERY powerful explosive devices such as the one that the IRA
	recently detonated, killing 1 and injuring 45?

	Can I have vinegar without license?  Hydrogen peroxide?  Where is the 
	line drawn?

	Yes they could, but are they good ideas?  Are they needed?  Is there
	any shred of sanity in them?  Scarcely, I trust.
