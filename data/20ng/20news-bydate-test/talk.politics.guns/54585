The crushed remains of a PRESSURIZED propane tank were found in the ruins
of the BD compound.  The key word is PRESSURIZED.  When that baby was 
crushed, the gas would have gone all over the place.  And when ignited, 
would look just like the pictures of the explosion we saw on the TV 
news.  Ammo doesn't go up all at once - kind of like fireworks going off.
Propane gas goes off in a big fireball.  Gee, that's kind of consistent 
with what the pictorial history shows.  Hmmmmm...

Remember, PRESSURIZED gas.  People all over the building.
Conflagration in less than a minute.  Huge explosion.  Gas masks being
worn by the inhabitants.  Makes a lot of sense that very few of those
on the inside would even know that the tank was damaged.  If they
thought it was just a normal fire, they would probably be trying to
put it out.  Then - BOOM - the fireball.  After that explosion and 
concussion, I doubt anybody on the inside of the building was capable
of moving.

: And besides... oh, I don't know why I'm even bothering.

Good question.  Take an objective look at what happened, listen to the 
things that the FBI said ("The BD's started the fire."  "The BD's bodies
were found with gunshot wounds.") that are now being refuted by the 
evidence being recovered.  Seems that the FBI is deliberately making
statements that have no rational basis in fact, and trying to make
them sound like fact.

Yes, I would still believe that the FBI and the BATF were on a non-stop
string of lies and half-truths.  This is consistent with their operations
on numerous occasions.

And as for the BD's being murderous, they did not cause any problems until
they were assaulted by the BATF.  So now a thought experiment for you:  If
the BATF had never stormed that farm, would four agents and 90 BD's be
dead today?

: Um, isn't that how all politicians are elected?

Yes.  That is how politicians are elected.  Kind of scary, isn't it.  Now
if we as a people actually held Mr. Clinton to his promises instead of
apologizing and denying that he ever made them, and actually expected
accountability by our government, I doubt that debacles like Waco would
happen as often as they do.

Acutally, no.  THe BATF has a rather checkered history of staging raids of
this sort just prior to the time when their budget comes up for review.  
Oddly enough, their budget was about to be reviewed just two weeks after
the initial raid on the BD's.  "Coincidence?  I think not!"

And as for the fire, what happened was caused by the act of knocking over
walls with an armored vehicle of destruction.  The FBI tried to convince
the world it was suicide, but all of the facts that are coming out by
the investigation of the Texas rangers and medical examiners point to 
a gas explosion and quick fire that decimated all of the occupants of the
building.  Sounds to me like a law enforcement agency that is trying to 
cover its ass.

Oh, please.  If you want to argue, argue.  If  you merely want to demean those
who see this differently than you, then please go somewhere else.
