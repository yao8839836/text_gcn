   I saw this nifty drawn out posting and I thought I might give the two of you
   a little help with your problem. As you both know what you posted,(and this 
   foolish thing gave me so much shit last time I tried to post) I took the 
   liberty of deleting all but the header and a single quote. I hope you don't
   mind.

   As written the second ammendment states rather clearly for anyone who can
   read the following:

 "  A well regulated militia, being necessarry to the security of a free state,
   the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."

  What is regulated? Regulated means "controlled"! How about security?
  Well hey! That would be along the lines of being and feeling safe wouldn't
  it? Wow! We have a concept forming here don't we!? Now what have we left?
  "the right of the people people people people people people people (sorry
  got kinda hungup there) shall NOT be infringed" Oops! Backup there,hmmm..
  "infringed"....That'd be like Interfered with, altered, changed or
  watered down in any way,shape or form! So! What we have here in it's big old
  long winded version would be.

  " A well controlled militia, being necessary to the secure/safe feeling of
  state, the right of the PEOPLE to keep and bear arms shall not be Fucked
  with in any way shape or form by some happy ass good for nothing in 
  some piddly government building who wants to run my life in the pursuit of
  his happiness!" The item is clear and concise in it's present form my young 
  friend! It does not need my clarification or that of any other. THIS IS
  ONLY AMMENDMENT which guarantees the continued existence of the others.
  It's whole purpose is to give people recourse against the military machine
  of a government which fails to properly represent it's creators!US!
