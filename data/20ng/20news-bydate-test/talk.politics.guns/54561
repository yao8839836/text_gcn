Well, I only saw it start in one place.  A tank punched a hole in a wall,
and as it withdrew flames came out and spread quickly in the direction that
a 30+ mph wind was blowing.  I saw a diagram in USA Today yesterday, and
fires started at 2 of the 3 holes that the tanks made.  A terrible, negligent
accident.

Maybe they couldn't.  I've often marvelled at how people could get burned alive
in the upstairs of a 2 story house on fire, but it happens all the time.
What if they were in sealed rooms, trying to avoid the gas, and didn't know
about the fire until it surrounded them?  Remember the Israelis hiding in
sealed rooms during Desert Storm to avoid gas-bearing Scuds?

Cripes, Mark, are you REALLY a college student?  Maybe you ought to stop
worrying about increased beverage access and start clearing your head.
Ever heard of questioning authority? 

>And besides... oh, I don't know why I'm even bothering.


OK, I'll buy that.  You _do_ seem totally clueless...

contrary. 

Wellllll....  They weren't murderous.  They'd never harmed or even threatened 
anybody until they were attacked by a paramilitary force using military weapons
and hardware.  And as far as "evidence", what are you talking about?  
Everything the Feds have said they've retracted practically as soon as they get
questioned in detail about it.  Maybe you and your Increased Beverage
Access buddies, sitting around the bar slurring stuff like "they shoulda
killed 'em all 51 days ago" don't feel that way, but then you're probably
one of those people still saying about Klinton "Give the guy a chance, we don't
even know what he's gonna do! (Burp)

>(No, I don't really expect a response to that challenge.)

No problem, you don't have any questions that scare any of us.  Most of our
minds are apparently more developed than yours.  

The answer is:  *YES!*  In a f*cking heartbeat!  

Thought Experiment:  Would you be mindlessly down on your knees with your mouth 
open, blissfully sucking up anything the Feds said if Bush were the president?
What, no comeback?  (OK, go ahead, say it.  "Read my lips, no new taxes" %^P   )

>Um, isn't that how all politicians are elected?

Not in such a great degree.  Bush broke one promise, maybe two (taxes/guns)
and we held him accountable for it.  Of course, it took him the better part of
4 years to do it;  Slick's only been in office 101 days and he's broken lots
of them.  Anddd...  I imagine he'll also be held accountable for that.

(I can just see the campaign buttons now:   "ABC - Anybody But Clinton")

Hmmm.... Apparently you just got here.  Nobody's claiming that it was anything
but a stupid mistake by a bunch of incompetent public employees who normally
don't get this kind of scrutiny when the mess up.  And as far as how they picked
the Davidians, who knows?  Maybe they figured that nobody'd care about such
a politically incorrect group as a bunch of fundies out on the Texas prairie.
Maybe they figured they'd just go in there and run roughshod over the BDs
during their religious services (which was the reason the Feds gave for the
timing of the raid) rather than running into resistance.  Maybe they KNEW
that the BDs weren't ANYWHERE NEAR as violent as the Feds' spin doctors are
trying to tell the public.  Maybe they were AFRAID to try this kind of thing
on the Crips and Bloods.  Maybe it was because the ATF's budget is up for
approval and they seem to favor doing something dramatic whenever that is
the case.  Of course, their reasoning doesn't matter, only what they did,
and this time, people are just paying more attention to it.


>And does Bill Clinton have cooler theme music than Darth Vader? 

Not if you mean that stupid "don't stop thinking about tomorrow"...

>How is he on diabolical laughter? 

All I've ever heard is Hillary's diabolical giggle.  Waffle Man seems to have
lost his sense of humor...

>Does he look good in a cape? 

Don't know, never seen him in one.  He probably looks fat and puffy faced,
just like in a suit.  I saw him in the Rose Garden the other day, and I
couldn't get over how much he is starting to look like Teddy Kennedy.


>These things MUST be investigated. You first.


Don't worry, these things WILL be investigated.  Now go back to your beer,
you dimwit....
