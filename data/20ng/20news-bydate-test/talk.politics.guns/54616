Pardon me, here, but I don't trust Spectre's motives here at all.  Spectre
was a major part of the Warren Commission, (remember the magic bullet theory?)
and is NOT to be trusted if there's even the tiniest chance the guv'mint may
have done something wrong.  If he gets a chance I'm afraid he will satisfy
the public outcry with another whitewash.

Right on the money here.  We should certainly applaud the disbanding of the 
BARTF but we must stress the personal responsibility of the goons who set
up the assault on American citizens.  

We must NOT count on Spectre, though, to get it done.
