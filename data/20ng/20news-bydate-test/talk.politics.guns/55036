The FBI, CIA, BATF, etc. ARE federal agencies, you are correct.  But to
think there is a visible and clear chain of command up to the Prez, and
that these agencies inform Reno who informs Clinton, etc. is naive.  These
agencies operate as distinct and seperate entities and while they have
ultimate accountability to the Prez, they make their own moves, and then
tell the Prez, who says, "I knew all along".  While this may not seem right,
or it may not fit our idealistic need to see a structured chain of command
leading to the White House, thats the way it is.  Bureaucracys are not, after
all, composed of 3 or 4 people who talk on a regular basis, have lunch, and
maybe golf together.  I do agree, the FBI, BATF messed up. I'm not sure if
they should have stormed the compound or not.  By the way, Jehova Witnesses
are a religious minority in this country.  Protestantism is a minority
religion in the World.  BDs were a cult by all definitions and history of
cults.  To say this is not to persecute a religious or ethnic enclave.
Koresh said he was the Messiah.  I was raised a Baptist, although I do
not practice the religion and do not think that the Big Guy upstairs is
digging the divisiveness, closemindedness, and right-wing morons that are
associated with the religion.  Anyway, the Messiah that I was taught about
would not be carrying a gun, let alone stockpiling weapons.  You can doubt
BATF reports all you want, David Koresh was not a poor soul who was
unjustly persecuted.  While some of the information coming from the U.S
government is being exagerated so as keep public opinion on their side, I
do believe that some of the things that former cult members have said
are true.  Anyway, this is just another excuse to try and blame President
Clinton for something.  People who attempt to do this for political motives
should be ashamed.  THEY are the ones who are keeping this country from
reaching its full potential.
