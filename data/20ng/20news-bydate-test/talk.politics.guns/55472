My sig has generated more mail than any of my posts.

Robin Hood is a school financing plan wherein property rich school districts
will have a portion of their tax revenue taken from them and given to property
poor districts.  The laudable plan is to equalize the per student spending. 
IMHO, however, it is a disaster waiting to happen.  Taxes will go up in 50% of
the districts and we will lose control of how OUR tax money is spent.  It
penalizes districts that have excelled.

And the election is Saturday. Along with city council, school board and the
unfinished Senate term.  And after I exercise one right, I'm going to exercise
another!
