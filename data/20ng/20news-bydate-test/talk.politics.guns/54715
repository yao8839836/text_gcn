Hey, joe -- assuming you're old enough to remember it -- how did you feel
about presidential responsibility every time Reagan said "I don't recall" 
about his arms-for-hostages meetings with the Ollie North gang?

How did you feel about it when Bush said he "was out of the loop on that
decision" when he was right there in the thick of it?

Oh, right.  "He was responsible in the sense that he was briefed, but so
what -- shit happens!"  Is that what you said?
