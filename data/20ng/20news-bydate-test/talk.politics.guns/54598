pete zakel is right, we don't need to worry about capitalization
rules. after all, the punctuation gives all the necessary information
about the sentence structure. why should anyone worry about whether the
text is as close to the original as possible. (sarcasm intended).

Then you didn't understand my grumble...  Again, I said to get a
CORRECT version of the Constitution.  The first indicator that
something is wrong (i.e. the copy has been modernized) is the modern
capitalization rules.  The next thing to go is the spelling, and then
I've even seen versions where the GRAMMAR was modernized (oh, but
don't worry, modernizing the grammar won't change the meaning of the
text, right?... ;-)  [p.s.  I have found about 10 *different* versions
of the Constitution on the network; And accuracy DOES matter...]
