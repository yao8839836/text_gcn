The Denver Post (supposed voice of the supposed Rocky Mountain Empire)
ran the following in the 'Firearms, Supplies' classified heading on 
Friday, 23 April 1993.  If you have an opinion about their new found
wisdom, I am told that the person to speak with is one Mr. Walters,
(303)820-1267.

	Notice

	The Denver Post will no longer 
	knowingly accept any advertise-
	ment to buy or sell assault weap-
	ons.  The Denver Post finds that 
	the use of assault weapons poses
	a threat to the health, safety, and
	security of its readers.

Let 'em know what you think...
