last remaining colonies:

>Are you for real?

>People dumb enough to give their money and possessions to a guy who says he's
>jesus deserve all they get

People who were dumb enough to believe Klinton was a moderate deserve what
they get too.  It's a real laugh to hear them try to justify this massacre
with bullsh*t about how concerned they were about how our tax money was
was being spent.  (Wasting money keeping Texans alive?  Hell no. let's
spend it to import Haitians with AIDS so we can treat them at taxpayer
expense.  %^P  )

>Anyway, he killed a few feds

So what?  The Feds killed 90+ civilians when they "ran out of patience", to use
their own phrase.  If the Feds hadn't attacked them, they'd all be home eating 
dinner with their families tonight.  Too bad, but they started it.  Maybe
next time they'll think twice.  That's worth 4 stormtroopers.

>He's not the goddam hero here

Nobody says he is.  What he was was a victim of a left-wing government,
that violated its pledge to protect and uphold the Constitution, run amok.  
Don't worry, though dweeb, we're gonna take it back.  (Hey, I'm a white guy,
but would it be OK if I quoted Malcolm X here, and said "by any means 
necessary"?  Nah, never mind.  We can do this legally...

>He's dead an' i'm happy!!!!!

NO, you're just a brainless f*cking trogladyte.  Go beat up some soccer
fans.  Ignorance is bliss, so drool on with that stupid smile on your 
face when people die needlessly. I hope a badger climbs up your kilt.

(Don't expect these UKies to care about this, folks...  these bastards
never did like the idea that we Americans had the means to defend ourselves 
and wouldn't stand for tyranical governments, which is why we sent them packing 
back to their dreary little island with their tails between their legs twice.)
