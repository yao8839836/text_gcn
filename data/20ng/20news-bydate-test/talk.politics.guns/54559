The House Document Room can be reached at +1 202 225 3456.  You need to 
have the number of the document you want (e.g. HR1036) and they'll be happy
to send it to you.  Tell them if it's going to be a big stack, because the
surly sounding guy who answers is scrawling in a really awful hand on the
back of the envelope that will come and will run out of room quickly if
you don't tell him.

The Senate document room is too important to deal with the likes of you
and I, and will answer requests from off the hill only by mail.
