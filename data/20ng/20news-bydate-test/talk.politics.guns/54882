I'm getting tired of these wimpy Liberals whining about gun control,
too!  Ya know, the Second Amendment says

	A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a
	free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms,
	shall not be infringed.

Now, notice, it says *arms*.  Not guns.  Arms.

The Comsymp ZOG wants you to think that it is the only legitimate
possessor of nuclear weapons.  Unconstitutional!  You and I have just
as much right to a kilogram or two of nice weapons grade plutonium as
any cruddy little pointy headed liberal Los Alamos pinkos.

Support your right to keep and bear short range nuclear weapons.  It's
a legitimate and challenging sport.

And screw the limit.
