Hey, guys.  You're absolutely correct, and well on the way to winning
this battle ... and losing the war.  Yes, there are serious philosophical
flaws in HR 1276.  Technical ones, too -- how'd you like to sue the Feds,
lose, and have to pay _their_ "reasonable Attorney's fee" ... ?    :-)

Still, I have one basic question:  compared to what we've _got_ is HR 1276
(a) better, or (b) worse?  This one shouldn't even take you three guesses.

If there's a good enough show of support for HR 1276, maybe for a change
_we_ could be the ones saying "it's a reasonable first step" ...
