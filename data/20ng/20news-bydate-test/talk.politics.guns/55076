When did Koresh go on a rampage?

What I saw was an unnecessary, unprovoked massive attack on Feb. 28th.

Probably even an illegal action by ATF, certainly way out of proportion
to anything reasonable.

And yet, according to a pole taken yesterday, 95% of the people poled
believe the government forces acted appropriately.  They don`t believe
Reno or the President have any guilt in ordering/allowing the attack.

I suppose they also believed things like:
"I would present a 5-year plan to balance the budget."
"We don`t need to lead with a tax increase...."
"It starts with a middle-class tax cut..."
"I`ll have the bills ready the day after I am inaugurated and we`ll
have a 100 day period....It will be the most productive in modern history."
"I will ask congress for a line item veto.."
"I will lift the social security earnings test.."

I personally prefer to disbelieve the government until they prove themselves
right, rather than the other way around.  That way I have a better than
50% chance of being right about my first guess!

Read the constitution sometime, it is supposed to protect the citizens
and their rights.  I am sick of the abuse of government power.

As Tom Jefferson said:
"When all government,..., shall be drawn to Washington as the centre of
all power, it will render powerless the checks provided of one government
on another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government
from which we separated."  (1821)
