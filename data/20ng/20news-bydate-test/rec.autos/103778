I think it was the reverse, the V4 being 2/3 of the V6.

It was also the worst engine that Ford (Europe) have ever made - bloody
awful reputation. It's most successful application being the Transit
van.

Saab gave up with this motor and then made the Triumph 1854 (half a Stag V8) under license (I believe), but with 2-litre capacity and perhaps a different
arrangement for the cylinder head studs, before developing their own straight 
four from the Triumph.
