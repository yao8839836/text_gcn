while it's being mentioned, i personally prefer the moonroof/sunroof/t-top/
targa thing as well.  I simply don't like cloth tops, nor the extra insurance,
nor the S**** color matching alot of companies do.  If i chose a convertible,
it'd be:

a) Mazda RX7 II.  I just like the way they look.  It'd have to be in black,
with color matched black top(they look good!)

b) VW cabriolet.  They do a suberb job of matching colors too.  Also, last year
for them!  {***COLLECTOR'S ITEM****}

c) mustang GT droptop...they look ok too.

i know this doesn't help, but i thought i'd do it anyway...:-)

good luck to your wife.(and you :-)

DREW
