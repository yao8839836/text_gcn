	Ok, so in my ongoing search for a sport utility, here's the latest;


Toyota 4runner:

	 Small. Small Small Small. The interior of this vehical is impossible
	for a large person. Too bad; it would have been the winner otherwise.

Nissan Pathfinder:
	
	Very low ceiling. My head hit the roof, Fun on bumps, no? Also has
	a cheap-looking interior.

Isuzu Trooper:

	Class act. This is a really, really nice vehical. Very comfortable,
	handled ok. Has really cool grab handles EVERYWHERE. But it's huge,
	and the engine is a bit too small for it's bulk; also the manual shift is 
	weird and kind of awkward. I'd buy this if it were $3k cheaper or 10"
	shorter. But at this size and for this price, no. I kept picturing trying to 
	park in in San Francisco. No Thanks.


Chevy Blazer:

	Cheap looking. Small. Not as small as the Toyota and Nissan, but still 
	too small.

Ford Explorer:

	This is no sports car, and it's certainly not for the serious off roader.
	But it's big enough to be comfortable without being as huge and heavy as the
	trooper. It's engine has plenty of power for everyday driving, though it would
	be nice if it had a *bit* more. The automatic tranny is pretty nice; head and
	shoulders above my '90 mazda MPV. The steering is not as tight as I'd like,
	but it's acceptable. The two door has easy-to-enter back seats (Easier to get
	into, in fact, than the driver's seat of the 4runner!) and with a 10" shorter
	wheelbase and the easier availability of a manual tranny, (Yes, I'm a manual 
	shift biggot, I admit it...) it's the one I'm thinking of buying. 


	So, that said, is there anyone out there who has one of these and hates it?
	Anyone had any major problems? Heard any horror stories? 

	Also, any reason to buy the ford over the mazda Navajo, both being essentially
	the same vehical?


			Thanks-


	-Karl
