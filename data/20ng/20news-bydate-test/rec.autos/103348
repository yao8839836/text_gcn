i think those with 1.6 MR2's would describe the engine as sweet if a
little loud, those with 2.2 MR2's i can't imagine any unbiased person
paying it any compliments.  sounded like my ex-dormmate's rusty chevy
chevette.  with the 1.6 i would want to redline it just for the music,
with the 2.2 i would short shift so that it would shut up..  the new
camry 2.2 features balance shafts.  i guess since the mr2 is getting
the axe, it is too late for them to do anything about this..

it is no mystery that the turbo mr2 is "only" 2 liters.. the engineers
had enough integrity to prevent any further abuses.  also, in europe
the MR2 Mk2 non-turbo was also "only" 2 liters.. as usual, the
undiscriminating american market (if it is japanese it *must* be good)
gets the dogs.. to be fair, we also got the turbo, which the europeans
did not.
