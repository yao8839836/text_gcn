Now, now, before we get too carried away here....

Keep in mind that owning any car in Korea is a luxury that only the ruling
class can afford.  Every government agency worth its salt finds some reason
to levy a tax on car ownership; last I heard, there were seven different
fees to pay to own a car.  I believe this is the sort of petty bureaucratic
inefficiency that new President Kim Young Sam wants to eradicate.  Basically,
I think the rules came into place as bureaucrats from plebian backgrounds
wanted to wreak revenge on the ruling class.  In exchange, zaibatsu's like
Hyundai screwed over smaller companies, perpetuating a vicious cycle.
I have faith that Korean people can potentially build cars as well as anyone
else, but for now Hyundai cars seem to reflect the tensions within society,
of screwy components that won't work together.  Stubborn like a mule, the
car either won't go forward or won't stop at all.
