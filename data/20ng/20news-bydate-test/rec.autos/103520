The new Cruisers DO NOT have independent suspension in the front.  They
still
run a straight axle, but with coils.  The 4Runner is the one with
independent
front.  The Cruisers have incredible wheel travel with this system.

The 91-up Cruiser does have full time 4WD, but the center diff locks in
low range.  My brother has a 91 and is an incredibly sturdy vehicle which
has done all the 4+ trails in Moab without a tow.  The 93 and later is even
better with the bigger engine and locking diffs.
