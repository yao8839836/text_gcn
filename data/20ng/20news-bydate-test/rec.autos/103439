My son is considering the purchase of a 71 MGB, which has been substantially
restored.  The odometer has rolled over, but we can't be sure of the actual
mileage.  The engine and drive train apparently weren't touched in the
restoration, except for a new carb and a few hoses.  He plans to do vacuum and
compression checks to see what they might tell us about the engine.  The body
and undercarriage have no visible rust, the interior is new, as are tires,
front brakes (not sure about the back), battery, bumpers and other misc parts.
The paint is checked in a few places, and scuffed here and there, allegedly by
a wind-blown car cover.  It seemed to handle OK, except for soft front shocks.
Questions:

Are there problem areas common to MGBs we should check out?

The brakes seem soft and rather ineffective; what should we expect in the way
of braking action?

It seemed to be "doggy" when accelerating from a stop.  What should we expect
it to do, given the 4-cylinder engine?

The top is in place, but will not reach a number of the snaps.  The weather
was cold.  Should the vinyl stretch and fit when it warms up, or is it forever
shrunk?

Is it normal for the wire wheels to be painted, or are they usually chromed?

Given this rather limited description, what would be a reasonable price?

Gee, this turned out to be a little long--sorry.  While my brother once owned
an XK120 Jag (what a car!) we're obviously not into sports cars.  Any help with
these questions, or suggestions on other things to investigate would surely be
appreciated.
