Drivel.  I received delivery of my '93 Trans Am 7 weeks after I 
ordered (promised 6-8 weeks), and paid $400 over dealer invoice, 
which is a $1425 discount off of MSRP.  I only have about 370 
miles on it, but so far no problems, and it seems very well put 
together.  By the way, first year production will be about 60,000 
cars.  Dealers would like you to think there is a shortage, but 
considering they only sold about 90,000 F bodies last year and the 
new model was introduced mid-year, that is not going to create a 
shortage.  GM planning on ramping to about 160,000 F bodies next 
year (according to a WSJ article).
 
Several people have mentioned seeing a photo of the '94 Mustang in 
Popular Mechanics.  I saw a photo of it in Motor Trend January 
1993 issue (p30).  Direct side on view.  Although they described 
it as a "seriously handsome car with broad shoulders," I thought 
it looked pretty boring in that view.  Roofline reminded me of a 
Toyota Celica (yuch!).  Description of mechanicals same as has 
been reported from the PM article.
