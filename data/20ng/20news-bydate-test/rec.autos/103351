I believe the interstates were origionally funded as part of a national 
defense plan etc.  The  requirements were to move heavy army trucks at 
70mph.

Still its amazing in Germany you can have cars traveling 155 mph and 65 mph 
on the same 3 to 4 lane road.  Around Washington DC they can't keep traffic 
flowing at 55.
