Because some people like them (and some people actually need them).

Yeah, right. Real muscle cars had a manual transmission, and their
clutches aren't that heavy. Shelby-American used plenty of
high-powered, high-torque engines, and Carroll only put autos in
his cars because people wanted them. (Blasphemers! Heretics!
Burn them, burn them for defiling a Shelby with an auto! ;-)
Real Cobras (and they were the ultimate sports car at the
time) had big-block Fords which turned out prodigious amounts
of power and torque, and _none_ of them had automatics. 

>And also, an automatic with a V8 engine can be real fun to drive.

Yeah, if you call a gear shift in the middle of a curve "fun." :-)

I personally would _love_ to have a '66 Galaxie 500 7-Liter Coupe,
with a fire-breathing 427 and four-onna-floor (to go along side
my '66 Galaxie 500 pillarless hardtop with a fire-breathing 390
with three-onna-tree; I love the sound of dual exhaust in the
morning! :-). There's no comparison between a REAL American
Muscle Car and a car with a big engine and an automatic, IMHO.
