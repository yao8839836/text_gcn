I just bought an Altima (and like it very much) and yes there is a
little Stanza logo ever so discretely placed on the trunk. The Altima is
emblazoned in big silver letters, but the itsy-bitsy Stanza is shunted
to the far left of the trunk lid. You can only see it if you get up
close to the car and know where to look. It is very inconspicuous.

In fact my first clue that this was a Stanza was that the owners manual
called the car a Nissan Stanza Altima.

Anybody know *why* Nissan did it this way?
