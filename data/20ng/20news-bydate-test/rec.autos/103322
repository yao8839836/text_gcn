folks,

i am going to be purchasing a new vehicle in the next few months.  i
am trying to hold out until the fall since i have heard that i can
be in a better negotiating position to purchase a '93 right when the
'94s are coming out.  i need something that can comfortably carry
2 adults, 2 kids in car seats, and 2 60-pound dogs.  i can probably
afford something in the 14k-16k range.  i am interested in the SUV's
but am not sure there are any that are decent which i can afford.
i think the ford explorer got good reviews from consumer reports but
is above my $$$ range.  the isuzu rodeo is probably in my price range
but i think consumer reports gave it a big thumbs down.  can anyone
offer any suggestions?  i am hoping for something a little more hip
than the traditional wagon, and the SUVs look like fun (we do a lot of
camping too).
