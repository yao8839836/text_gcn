i say extended warranties are a ripoff, high-profit item for dealers.
but what i really want to point out here is that you are not buying
5/60k, 6/75k, 6/100k.  you get 3yr/36k *free*.  so what you are buying is
2/24k, 3/39k, 3/64k.  keep that in mind when you look at the cost vs. coverage.
another point is that many car companies routinely fix car problems that are
out of warranty...why?  design/manufacturing defects that the company owns up
to, keeping customer happy, etc.
