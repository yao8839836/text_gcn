It seems that there are more and more "bands" available for
police radar each month.  I have recently purchased (within
the last 8 months) the BEL 966STW.  While it is not a perfect
detector by any means, it does do the job fairly well.  

Now, however, I pick up a car magazine at the airport and
read about this Super Ka Wideband which is a superset of
the Ka Wideband that this latest generation of detectors
was touted as covering.  

So now BEL has a NEW series of detectors out that cover all
the usual bands (X, K, Ka photo, Ka wideband) as well as the
new Super Ka wideband.  

Just as there comes a point of diminishing returns when chasing
increased PC computing power with faster and faster CPUs (for
the average home consumer, at least), it seems that there is
now the same concern with radar detectors.  Does it make sense
to upgrade just 8 months after purchasing my "new" detector?
Is Valentine upgrading their equipment?  If so, it might be 
worth it for me to upgrade to the Valentine.  I was in the 
market for a Valentine when I purchased the BEL but the
3-4 month waiting time was just too much for me since I had
inadequate protection with my Passport.  Life was much simpler
when there was just X and K band and Escort has the best
equipment on the market and there was no need to continuously
shop for a new detector.  I hope that the flood of new radar 
bands ceases with this new Super Wideband business.
