The whire wheels aren't chromed, they were to be painted silver/grey.

The accelerating from a stop shouldn't be "doggy" because of the light
weight of the car.

Don't pull the topto make it reach the snaps, I pulled a couple out of
the top doing that.  Replacing the spanps usually doesn't work.  Let it
sit in th e sun, open on the car for a couple hours, the try,  GENTLY!!!!

I continually blew up the #4 connecting rod bearing, be sure your not
buring too much oil.

Don't expect too much of a smooth ride.  The lever arm shocks hold the
road, and your bladder.  The are ultra-expensive.  Supposedly the can be
rebuilt.  J. C. Whitney sell a shock replacement kit the uses standard
shocks.

I had to rebuid boththe brake and clutch master cylinder, in addition to
the clutch slave.  This work made a world of changes.

Be sure the carb is the original type replacement.  My 1970 had dual
Stomberg oil dampenned side draft carbs.

Ask if the clutch has ever been replaced.  To replace the engine and
tranny have to be pulled as a unit.

If you need more, I had mine all through hiogh school.  Lots of
maintenance to use every day.
