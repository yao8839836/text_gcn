I don't have any written data but I know what I have experienced.  I use  
S-50 in everything including my lawnmowers.  In my car it smoothed the idle
and reduced the operating temp by 5 degrees.  I havent used it long enough 
to test for wear, but some people I know have.   
 A farmer that lives near by used to have to overhaul his big deisel tractors
at least every other year if not every year.  Since he has been using S-50
he has went 5 years without an overhaul.

Also a friend at a machine shop has in the past rebuilt engines with 200K
miles on them because the coustomer thought it was time.  These coustomers
had ran S-50 since almost new.  It was found when measuring the internals
of the engine that they showed only about the amount of wear that would be
expected of 30K miles not 200K.

In my opinion it works.
