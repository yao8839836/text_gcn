Hi everybody ...

Well I don't know if this is a known problem
to you in the big state but over here in Europe
it is in some places ...
It just happened to me and I payed A LOT to get my 
new Honda Civic repaired.
A marten choose my car to stay one night in and this
damn little animal damaged almost everything which
was plastic/rubber ..
I never thought that these little #@%##@ could do that
much damage.

So to ALL you car owners out there :

Is there a GOOD known method of gettin' rid of  this animal ???
except for waiting all night long beneath my car with a gun ???

HELP IN ANY FORM WOULD BE APPRECIATED VERY VERY MUCH !!!!
