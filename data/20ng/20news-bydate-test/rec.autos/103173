Either I've just fallen for this, or you guys
are _really_ paranoid!

You're actually worried about somebody stealing 
your oil?

C'mon, you think a vandal'll do that?!

That's absolutely ridiculous!

Besides, how hard is it to get under the car to 
change the oil?

I can say from experience on the cars that I've driven and
changed the oil on, my Mazda 323 is pretty much a pain, but
once you've done it once, you don't forget how, and it
gets easier.

I can't imagine any other cars are much worse than mine.
