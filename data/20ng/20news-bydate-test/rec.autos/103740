One more way, which works in manual trans cars I've driven, and it is my
personal favorite (the other suggestions above are great, but try this
one, too).  

While pushing the shifter *gently* towards reverse, let the clutch out
slowly (right to the friction point) and the shifter will be pulled into
position. If you do it right, the car won't jump backward, nor will the
gears grind.... You will just glide back.
