 Energy Secretary Hails President's Plan For Alternative Fuel
Vehicles
 To: National Desk, Environment and Energy Reporters
 Contact: Larry Hart of the U.S. Department of Energy, 202-586-5806

   WASHINGTON, April 21  -- Secretary of Energy
Hazel R. O'Leary today said President Clinton's Executive Order on
Alternative Fuels will make the federal government a "driving force
behind efforts to increase the availability of both alternative
fuel vehicles and fuel supplies."
   President Clinton signed the order today, which calls for
federal purchases of alternative fuel vehicles in numbers over the
next three years at least 50 percent higher than those called for
in the Energy Policy Act of 1992.
   President Clinton also announced that Texas Land Commissioner
Gary Mauro will head up the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to
advise O'Leary on implementation of the Executive Order.
   "I am delighted that I will be working with Gary Mauro to make
this happen," O'Leary said.  "As Land Commissioner, Gary Mauro has
helped make Texas a national leader in converting the state fleet
to alternative fuels, and has been a tireless proponent of natural
gas vehicles in speeches across the country."
   The task force is to issue a report within 90 days recommending
a plan and schedule of implementation.
   "The Department of Energy and all of us in government must lead
by example if the option of alternative fuels is going to become a
practical, affordable choice for fleet owners across the country,"
O'Leary said.  "Increased use of domestically-produced alternative
fuels means reducing pollution while creating jobs.  We believe
that energy efficiency, protecting the environment, and a healthy
economy are complimentary goals."
   O'Leary said that plans call for the Department of Energy to
coordinate the agencies' five-year purchase plans, help with
funding for extra purchase or conversion costs, and work with GSA
to encourage development of the fuel infrastructure needed to make
fleet conversions practical.
   Under the order, the Department of Energy will also be working
with states, local governments and industry to coordinate vehicle
purchases and encourage manufacturers and fuel suppliers to make
alternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuels more widely
available.
