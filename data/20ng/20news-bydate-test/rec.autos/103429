Geico supports (reads gives to police) Laser Radars.  They have been known 
to be very picky.  No sports cars. No radar detectors (although Maryland 
insurance board over rules this consistantly). No turbos.

Basically it seems if you need to use your insurance ever they don't want 
you.  They once told me they wouldn't insure me (perfect record) because of 
my corvette even though it would be insured by another specialty insurance. 
 "We must insure all the cars".  I think this rep didn't know what she was 
talking about.

Geico is cheap.  But if you ever file a claim be prepared to be dropped.  I 
think in most areas two tickets will do it.

Geico will never see a dime from me If I can help it.

State Farm.  Slighty higher than most but very good response.  Not as picky 
as Geico.
