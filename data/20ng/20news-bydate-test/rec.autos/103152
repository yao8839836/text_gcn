I came across this interesting information in my local public library while  
researching minivans.  It is the dealer price and the retail price for a  
minivan I am thinking about purchasing.  Someone told me that the number for  
base price was slightly lower than the current price, but this should still  
give you some idea about pricing and how much you can negotiate.
