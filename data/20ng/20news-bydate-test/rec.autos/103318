Just for the record, read your owner's manual before attempting a push start.
Most manufacturers today do not recommend this (I think the catalytic converter
is the primary reason - unburned gas goes down to it and may ignite when
the converter gets into its operating range).

The best reason for a manual? Because you like to drive one. I find that its
much easier to develop lazy habits in an auto trans car. Remember, pay 
attention out there - stupidity behind the wheel has still taken more people
to the morgue than drunk driving. The problem is that we don't revoke peoples
license for stupidity.
