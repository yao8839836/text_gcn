You Ford vs Chevy people must live in the planet of Detroit or Droid.

Like they say in the airforce, with enough horsepower anything will fly.

I can put a 32valve V-8 with twin Garret-4s on Yugo and get 7.7sec QM.
Thats useless ... Its still a Yugo that will loose any race on a track,
or on the street.

Have you Detroit beings compared the ultra-long-throw stick shifts of
the 5.0 with the 93 MR2 turbo or 93 RX7 (I ll buy it in 6 mos) ?

Or the Torsen differential of the RX7 compared to the Differential of 
the 5.0 that sounds in every hairpin turn ?

And bythe way 5.0 and Camaro both have drums on the rear breaks ...
Hello , this is the 90 's ?
