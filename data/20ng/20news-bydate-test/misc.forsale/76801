Ensoniq SQ-80 Cross-Wave Synthesizer:
I have an SQ-80 for sale.  The SQ-80 is a powerful performance
oriented synth with a limited on-board sequencer.  I bought it because
it has a very large timbral repertoire;  it seems to do meaty analog
synth sounds as well as sounds that are considerably more "digital".
Below are a list of features extracted from the owner's manual:
  o Eight-voice polyphonic poly-timbral synthesizer, capable of
    playing eight different sounds at once, with dynamic stereo
    panning for each voice
  o Voice section employing Cross-Wave synthesis;  combine different
    attack and sustain wave segments to create complex, dynamic sounds
  o 75 sampled waves (includes a drumset) serve as the sound source
  o Dynamic voice allocation:  each sequencer track/MIDI channel has
    access to all eight voices
  o A full-featured MIDI controller keyboard capable of sending eight
    MIDI program and volume changes at once.  Keyboard is velocity
    sensitive, and transmits/receives velocity and polyphonic aftertouch.
  o Powerful matrix modulation scheme allows a very wide range of 
    modulation sources and routings.
  o A 3.5" floppy disk drive which writes/reads ordinary DS/DD disks
    allows fast and reliable storage of up to 600 sequences and up to
    1728 sound patches on a single floppy disk.  Also has a RAM-cart slot
    for patches that is compatible with ESQ-1 RAM-carts.
  o Does sysex dumps to its floppy disk for any sysex capable MIDI device
  o 80 character fluorescent display and user-friendly "page-driven"
    programming scheme provides a fairly humane user interface
  o Stereo line-outs, and stereo headphone jack for private listening
  o Sound programs and sequences are upwardly compatible with the ESQ-1
    so that sounds and sequences created for the ESQ-1 can be played on
    the SQ-80.

This SQ-80 has been the main MIDI controller in my studio for quite a while
now.  It has performed ably in that role, and has also been a heavily
used sound source at the same time.  The SQ-80 seems to have been designed
with this role in mind, and it works very well with my software sequencer
(WinCake) in its multitimbral mode.

>From a synthesis point of view, this machine is a hybrid.  It uses looped
short samples (there are 75 of them) as sources, then these waves
are processed with a sophisticated DCF-DCA arrangement.  The SQ-80
is capable of great things because of its 4-pole analog lowpass filter.
Simply put, it makes fabulous analog synth sounds.  But unlike most
good analog synths, it has a very thorough MIDI implementation so that it
works very well with a MIDI sequencer.  What I really like most about this
thing is that it is capable of making a very wide range of sounds.
This SQ-80 is about 5 years old (mfg. date 1/21/88).  It does have
an 8-track sequencer, but like most on-board sequencers, it is a pain
to use so I have avoided it.

REASON FOR SALE:
I am selling my SQ-80 because I recently joined forces with another individual
here in Boston, and we have more keyboards than space to put them.  I
recommend it for someone who is getting started in sequencing and needs a
powerful but economical master keyboard.

PRICING AND TERMS:
I paid $1300.00 for this synth a few years ago.  I am willing to accept
$650.00 (average r.m.m.s asking price is $733.00).  I will include a bunch of 
patches on SQ-80 floppy disks for the buyer of this synth, as well as the 
original Ensoniq SQ-80 owner's manual.

Price:    Asking $650.00 (everything)
Shipping: split shipping (UPS Surface COD) anywhere in the lower 48 states
