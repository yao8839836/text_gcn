I have a Powerbook 170 4/40 that is over 1 year old with no warranty but, in
perfect condition (with original Apple fax/modem), that I would consider
selling you for around a $1000.  Get back to me with what you think would be
equitable arrangements (sp?).  Have all manuals and system disks, some software
in boxes and loaded, but threw out the Mac packaging.
