I am not a company, thus this is not a commercial sale.  

I purchased 256 T-shirts last fall for a fund raiser that fell through. 
We didn't have the time to sell the shirts.  I have about 175 shirts
left and I am willing to sell them to you for $5.25 a piece (more than a
dollar discount of what you would have paid the supplier for the shirts,
even in bulk)  (That's $918.75 for 175 shirts)  These shirts are Jim
Morris T-shirts.  They are all 100% cotton and most have more than 4
colors.  (They are clean and neatly folded in a box.  If any happen to
be damaged I will refund your money for each damaged shirt or replace
it, your option.)  You could sell them for at least $8 to $15 a piece
(the higher number is for the nicer shirts) to raise money for a school
event or a organization.  I realize it is a big investment, but it could
pay off big.

I would be willing to sell the shirts in lots of 50 but only at $5.50 a
shirt.  I will pay shipping, but prefer local buyers and will give them
more bargaining power.

Please help me.  I do not have the time to sell these shirts and I need
the money.  I am taking a big loss by selling this cheap.  I will give
you Jim Morris' phone number so that you can varify the prices.

All prices are negotiable.

Please email tf26@andrew.cmu.edu and tell all of the clubs in the area
about this deal.  Once they're gone, they're gone (cause I am not a
business.)
