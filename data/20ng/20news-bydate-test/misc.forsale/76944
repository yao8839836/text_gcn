Most comics are in near mint to mint condition, are bagged in shiny 
polypropylene bags, and backed with white acid free boards.  Shipping is
$1.50 for one book, $3.00 for more than one book, or free if you order 
a large enough amount of stuff.  I am willing to haggle.

I have thousands and thousands of other comics, so please let me know what 
you've been looking for, and maybe I can help.  

I will trade for other comics as well as computer equipment, video
equipment, etc...  Let me know what you want to trade!!
