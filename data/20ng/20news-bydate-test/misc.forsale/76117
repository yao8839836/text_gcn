 at jack@acs.bu.edu. Also, a 10% automatic discount will apply if
 your total purchase price is $100 or more (except the two brand
 new items). Buyer(s) pay shipping.
 
 If you think the prices I listed above is unrealistic, please mail
 me back and I would take your advice into consideration and make the
 proper adjustments.

 The reason I am selling this stuff is because I have decided that
 I had enough with this hobby of PC computing and I want to move on
 other interests.

 One last thing, if you know any non-profit organization whom might
 be interested in my equipments, please let me know. Because if no
 one wants to buy them, I might as well donate them and get a tax
 break...

 Thanks.
