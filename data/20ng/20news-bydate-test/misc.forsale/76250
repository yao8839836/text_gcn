     For Sale:  24 Pin Printer - ALPS Allegra 24

     Asking Price:  $150 shipped prepaid
                             (C.O.D. orders pay C.O.D. shipping).

     Features:

            Straight paper path (won't jam).
            Paper saving tear-off capability (no need to waste a sheet to
               get a current printout).
            Programmable preferences (you don't even need a computer)
            Letter Quality 360dpi output
            Epson LQ2500 emulation built-in
            Card slot for additional memory / font upgrades
            Printer ribbons easily found (there are three or four sources
               for ALPs ribbons in every Computer Shopper).
            Fast 180 CPS output
            This printer has not even been used in the last two years (three
               years old) because I have a laser printer at work and use that
               instead.
            Originally $399.

            I'll even throw in two ribbons (may need simple reinkings tho).
