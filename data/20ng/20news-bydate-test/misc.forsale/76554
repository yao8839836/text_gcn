Greetings netters,
	I have the following items for IMMEDIATE sale.  I need the money and
if you need the stuff, we can work out a deal.  :)

Sharp single disk cd player
	Originally paid oodles, but that was a couple of years ago.  It works
	well, has all the standards...(remote sensor[remote not included];
	20 track pragrammable memory; etc.)  I got a new one and need to sell
	this one.  Please email me an offer!!  (it's the standard black 
	component style cd player)

3.5" 1.44 meg floppy drive
	A real IBM floppy drive with cable and mounting case.  I paid $40
	a couple of months ago.  The drive works (as last time in).  I
	would like to get the $40 back for it, but OBO applies.

5.25" 360K floppy drive
	I'm sure someone out there needs an extra 360K.  It works great and
	is nice and quiet.  Again, please email offer.

RC10 remote control car
	4 time world leader design.  It was just overhauled.  It runs great,
	even though the body if not all that pretty.  Has new engine in it 
	as well as racing pinion.  The chassis is nicked up from hard running,
	but it's still a great car.  Does not include electronics.  Comes 
	with monster truck conversion kit (wheel arms already installed)-virgin
	truck body and bumper etc.  Car+kit=$100+20=$120 OBO...make an offer!

D&D stuff...you name it, I probably have it.  Please send email regarding what
	you want...or a request for sale list.  I hate to part with any of it, 
	but needs are needs, eh?  

Misc CD's
	Alice in Chains - Facelift    $8
	Skid Row (self titled)  $8  both obo...really.

Box of computer printer paper...paid $20 for it, make offer.

I might have 4 1*9 meg **60** ns SIMMS forsale if I get a new motherboard...
	if you interested, the price is $40 a piece sold as a set.
