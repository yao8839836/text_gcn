Each contains all the stamps issued for that year along with descriptive
information regarding each issue. The stamps are mint never hinged. The
RETAIL (not catalog) prices listed are from the leading United Nations
dealer, Mike Armus. The stamps were issued for use by the U.N. offices
in New York and Geneva Switzerland.

Price: TAKE 50% the current retail price for any folder. Take 10 or more
folders take 60% OFF the total. Take all 32 folders take 65% off the total.
In many cases these folders are priced at or below the face value of the
