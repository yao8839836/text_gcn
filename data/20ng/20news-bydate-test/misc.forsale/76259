Asking for $500 or best offer...

I paid $697 for the whole package. And it is too late for me to get the 
refund. I would sell it for $500 for the whole package. Details could be 
provided by request. I do wish to sell the whole package at once. So if 
you are just looking for the vacation vouchers, I don't care if you 
sell the camera to other for a higher price. If you are interested in 
the camera, you could treat the vacation vouchers as gift.

Some of you might receive a letter in your mail box which says that you 
are selected to be part of the sweeptake and you have at least one out 
of five awards. Trust me, you would get the exactly the same package as 
I did. There is only one award which will be given away. So don't 
bother even to call them back, if you are really interested, you could 
get it from me for a cheaper price. And you could receive the package 
within a week ( I waited three months to get my first and final packages). 
Also, they would ask for your credit card number and you have to pay 
for the interest to the credit card company. So why spend more than you
should when you could get them from me for a cheaper price.

If you are interested, please reply to me as soon as posible. I really
wish to get this over with. Make me an offer, if I am confortable with
your offer, I would send the package by U.P.S. the next day morning.
More details could be given if you wish.
