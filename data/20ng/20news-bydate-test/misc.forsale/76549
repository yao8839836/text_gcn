I still have about 70 records left on hand, all in pristine condition
(except where noted), quite a few out-of-print and more than a few
imports in the bunch.

Rather than selling the majority for $3-4 each, I'm looking to barter
packages for stuff that you might be selling over USENET.  I'll also
trade for other records in very good condition that you've replaced
with CD, as well as pre-recorded videos on Beta or VHS.  In the past,
I've been able to make deals based on the equivalent list/store price
(e.g., 1 CD = 1 movie in Beta format*) to get around what you or I
might have originally paid (as if we can even remember!  (-;) **

[At this time, I'm looking for a set of working AA NiCad rechargable
batteries ... if you have some lying around, and they're sound, RSVP!]

So if you're curious, RSVP for my list and if you see anything that
you like, send back a proposal for a record package and a copy of
your ad for the stuff you're selling ... thanks!

* i.e., the imports and out-of-prints are also valued at 1 used CD;

** I once got a 2400 baud external modem for 10 records (list $81);
Anybody got a nice, unused blender for making frozen margaritas? (-;

PS: There have been NO additions since the last posting in February;
        the list has only shrunk as I've made a few deals since.
