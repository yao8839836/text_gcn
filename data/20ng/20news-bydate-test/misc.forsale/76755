++++++++++++++++++++++++ CAR AMPLIFIERS FOR SALE +++++++++++++++++++++++++

I have 3 high-end car amplifiers for sale:

(2) Old-Style Rockford Fosgate 150's.  These are great amps, and I've never
    had a minute's trouble with either of them.  I've been running them on
    high end for quite some time (front/rear) and have been very pleased
    with them in that setup, but I've also run them on low end before, and
    they perform quite well in that situation as well.  I'm trying to sell
    them because I'm considering upgrading to a Rockford 650.  I already
    own a Power 300, and I've always liked the way the 650/300 combo worked
    in cars.

    I'm asking $200.00 a piece, and list on them when I bought them was
    $375.00.  If you're interested in both of them, I'd be willing to come
    down on the price a little bit.


(1) Precision Power 2150.  This great utility amplifier is rated at 2x150,
    and looks brand new.  The shroud is unscratched, and it works great.
    This is a great low-end amp because of it's high-power rating into
    2 channels, however, I've also had it running front or back high end
    before where it did very well.

    I'm asking $425.00 for this amp, but feel free to make me an offer on
    it.
