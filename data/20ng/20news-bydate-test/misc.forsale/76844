I have for sale the following:

	Hewlett Packard 500 Deskjet
	4 Additional Deskjet Ink Cartridges
	8 ft. Parallel Printer Cable

The printer is approx. 2 years old (7 months of use, and then a year
in storage during my relocation from Illinois to Columbus) and
in excellent condition. All original manuals, and boxes are included.
The selling price is $325.00 for the entire package. Unwilling to 
break it up because what good would cartridges do me without a printer.

If interested call either (614) 860-2144 or (614) 771-8861. You can also
respond via e-mail.
