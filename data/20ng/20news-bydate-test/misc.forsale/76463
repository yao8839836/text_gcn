All comics are in near mint to mint condition, are bagged in shiny 
polypropylene bags, and backed with white acid free boards.  Shipping is
$1.50 for one book, $3.00 for more than one book, or free if you order 
a large enough amount of stuff.  I am willing to haggle.

I have thousands and thousands of other comics, so please let me know what 
you've been looking for, and maybe I can help.  Some titles I have posted
here don't list every issue I have of that title, I tried to save space.
