Comments:

        Purchased locally at Micro Center in Columbus, OH 7 months ago.  All
	original packaging, receipts, and manuals are included.   Under
        warranty.   The keyboard on this machine is the best I've seen; I
	prefer it to the keyboard on most desktop units. I typically
        get 3-4 hours of battery life.  The battery recharges in 2 hours to 
        full charge.   The machine is quite speedy; I run OS/2 2.1beta
	on it currently and will leave this operating system installed unless
	you prefer MS-DOS 5.0 (included).
   
        I'll include a padded carrying case, also made by Toshiba.

Price/terms:

	$1900 (semi-firm), certified check.    If outside of Columbus, I will
	pay for COD shipping.
