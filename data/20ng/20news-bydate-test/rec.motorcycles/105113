If possible, I split lanes. Even if you don't get all the way to the
head of the line, at least you won't rear-ended. I always worry more when
I'm in the lane, at the front of the line, and no one in behind me. Then you
have to keep an eye on your mirrors. I also get ready to pull a hard right,
*just in case*.
