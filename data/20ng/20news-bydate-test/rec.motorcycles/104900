I've only ever done it in an automatic. I was sitting in my Olds, in
the winter, at a light, when I heard screeching behind me. I managed to
dart into the left turn lane before the sliding Jetta wound up half
where I was and half in the parked car beside where I was. I've never
had occasion to do it on a bike, but I imagine that it would be even
easier, because you could slip beside the car in front. Giving a gander
at the mirrors while at a light will give you time to get the clutch
out smoothly when you notice trouble, instead of waiting for the
screeching.
