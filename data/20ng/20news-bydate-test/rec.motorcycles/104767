Glad to hear that the bozo managed to stop.  I've only been riding for
about two years, but here are my rules for traffic light survival:

     - I try to *never* stop just over a hill behind a car.  If I have
       to stop in such a location, I pull almost completely next to the
       car in front of me.  If I'm the only one (ie no car in front), I
       turn the bike somewhat sideways across the lane, to increase my
       visibility to any oncoming vehicle.  Make sure to keep your
       taillight visible to traffic, though. (NOTE:  My bike is bright
       white; turning sideways on a black bike might not be as beneficial.)

     - On a flat road, I stop with a bit of room ahead of me (usually
       about two or three bike lengths).  This will (hopefully) give
       me room to pull forward and to the side as a car approaches.

     - If you are the last in a line of vehicles, watch your mirrors
       *constantly!*  If you see a vehicle approaching, and can't see
       any evidence to indicate that he/she is slowing down, get out
       of the way *now!*

     - Flicker your brake light.  If I'm the last vehicle in line, I
       will pull and release the brake as a car approaches from
       behind (noticed the car by watching my mirrors, of course :-).
       I vary the speed of the flicker, hoping to make the cager notice
       that there's something in the lane ahead of him.

Now, with all that said, it's the situation where you are first in line
that I feel most defenseless.  If you're first in line, your forward escape
route is seriously limited - you can only move forward to the extent that
you don't enter the intersection.  I leave some room behind the stop line
(although around here, the #@$*! light activators are always right up 
next to the stop line!), and watch the mirrors.  I *think* I've decided
that hopping off the bike might be the best way out of this situation.
Any other ideas for being first in line with no traffic directly behind
you?
