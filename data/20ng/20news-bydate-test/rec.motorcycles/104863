In light of the last letter I posted from Jeff Brody concering the crap
that is going on in the MOA, (which some folks took not as dissemination 
of information that I received, but as my own bad mouthing) I thought that
I would post this one, which came to me yesterday.  This is from board member
Robert Higdon to MOA Pres Chich Morse.  This is NOT my words, O.K. guys?

re:  Cecil King's Nominating Statement 

Dear Chick:
      We have a very serious problem with the election for president of the 
MOA this year.  Cecil King's nominating statement (as it appeared in the
Owners News) is 968 words, nearly twice as many as that is permitted by
the by-laws.  In pertinent part, the rules state:

"Each candidate's biography and position statement shall be limited to
a combined total of no more than 500 words. The nominating committe shall cut afafter the 500th word any biography and position statement exceeding this length.

    Obviously the nominationg committe was not up to the task.  Had Cecil's
statement been cut as required, it would have concluded approximately with
the word "undertiding" [sic] in the second paragraph after the commencement
of his Position Statement.  As a result, Cecil has obtained what I view as a
grossly unfair advantage over the other candidates for president.  This does
not just taint the election for that office; it makes a mockery of the 
process.  I would appreciate your advising the board immediately what steps
you intend to take to rectify this caricature of a fair election.
     Parenthetically, in your private correspondence with others, I would
be most appreciative that when tou call me an "asshole" you remind the
letter's recipient that the re-publication of such a comment is almost
guaranteed to have woeful consequences.
   With kind regards, I remain,
                                 Robert Higdon

O.K. MOA'ers, You read it, think for yourself, I trust you do know who
Cecil King is, and that he was Editor befor Don Douglass, and he is
a pres. candidate.  I let you draw your own conclusions.
