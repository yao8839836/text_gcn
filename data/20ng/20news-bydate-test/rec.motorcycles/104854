Well, as many a bored bike tourer can tell you, the way to steer
sans hans is to push your body off to the side you want to lean.
Say you want to turn left.  You push your body off to the left.
To do this, you have to push against something, and the only
thing to push against is the ground (through the bike).  Well,
the apple guy (Wozniak? or was that Churchill?) says that the 
ground will push you right back.  So, you pushed yourself off to 
the left by pushing on the ground to the right, and the ground 
pushed back toward the left.  Well, that push is on both wheels.  
The rear wheel doesn't care (unless you have serious bearing 
problems) (except of course on the Spagthorpe Dragonfly, which
had the revolutionary countersteering-contra-shaft-drive rear end), 
but the front wheel has trail.  If the ground pushes the front wheel 
toward the left at the contact patch, the trail will cause the 
wheel to turn to the right.  Hey, there we are.  No-hands counter-
steering.
