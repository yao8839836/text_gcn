I was privelged enough to experience my first Volvo attack this weekend.

I was last in a line of traffic that was about 6 vehicles long, riding
down Rt. 40 in Groton Ma.  At the side of the road, sitting off on the
shoulder was the killer Volvo in question.  No brake lights, no turn signal,
nothing.  We were doing about 40 mph and I was following the cage in front
of me about 2.5-3 sec. back.  Well, as said cage passes the Volvo, the
Brain Dead Idiot (tm) behind the wheel decides that she doesn't need to wait
for me to pass also and turns out perpendicular across both lanes of traffic
so that she can turn around...  So I get on the brakes in a effort to not
T-bone it, and the horn in an effort to wake the BDI up.  As she finishes
the turn, she looks up at me with a completely blank, uncomprehending
stare.

Where can I get rocket launchers for the VFR?
