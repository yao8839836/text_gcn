Spring break, I went through the four corners area and back.  The most
beautiful stop I made was in Utah at the Needles Overlook.  Though this
is a bit further east than where you appear to be going, I highly
recommend it.  IMHO it is far more beautiful than the Grand Canyon.  It
was not well marked, but was one of few paved roads off of US191 (I was
heading north from Monticello).  In order to get to the right place, I
should clarify that it is the Needles OVERLOOK, and not the recreation
area.  Heading north from Monticello, it is the second turnoff, and may
have been marked as the Anticline Overlook.  Anticline overlook is
about 20 (dirt, if this matters to you) miles past the Needles
overlook.  The road out to the overlook is paved and reasonably
maintained (I ran it about 70mph).

Looking out from the overlook was like being God and looking down on 
the world.  If it isn't too far out of your way, you should see it.
