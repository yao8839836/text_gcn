Now just wait one cotton picking minute here.... DoD rule 417.1.2 section 6
paragraph 3 clearly indicates that multiple people can't lay claim to a bike
in an "obvious" ploy to "artificially" increase the size of their stable...

So the question of the day is... Is Spike owned by a lady of true class and
breeding (my definition: any woman who rides :-) ) or by Tom the harely head???
I also note that you lay no claim to Connie or Ol Sport. (Like I said, 
obviously a lady of discriminating taste...)

Bored minds wanta know.
