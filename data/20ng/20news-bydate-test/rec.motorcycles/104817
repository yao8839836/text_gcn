They bein' themfolk who tend to compose fair piece of the population;
bein the ones that regard bikers as a loud, irresponsible, irreverent,
reprobate rabble.  
Sure you didn't rape and pillage-- It's a relief to know that you were
such gentlemen-- but because you were not completely out-of-hand you 
justify your lesser indescretions?  Some pretty distorted thinking, I
should say.  
Oh-- I'm sorry, I just noticed that you left mucho bucks (as in MONEY)...
Nevermind my criticism, I was out of line.  I forgot that when one leaves
mucho bucks (as in MONEY) their behavior is permissable, perhaps even 
justified.

Keep in mind that "themfolks" are the ones that could give a %$#@! when 
a biker gets killed, when *their* elected officials institute further
draconian legislation (helmet laws, gun controls, etc.), the ones that don't 
respect our rights on the roads because we do not respect theirs all "the
rest of the time..."
Need I continue?

So continue to wear your stigma as a badge, but the next time you are
whining about "them" and the effect of their values on yours, remember
that it was probably the behavior of self-righteous wusses like myself
that kept "them" at bay for this long.

Enjoy,
