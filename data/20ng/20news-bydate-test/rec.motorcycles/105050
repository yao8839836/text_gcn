	Sorry to be contradictory, but... I've had my Nighthawk at 45 degress
with the horizon and I wasn't banked over in a turn...  
	The hard part is getting the front in off the ground.  I rev to about 
7,000 at DROP the clutch.   Even harder is keeping it from coming up to far--
I use the back brake as well as the throttle.  Once its up, it'll wheelie just
like any other bike.
