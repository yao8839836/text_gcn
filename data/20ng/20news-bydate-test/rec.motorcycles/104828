Hi.

I'm not sure what the other guy (can't track down his post for his name)
was talking about when he made the claim that cobralinks are not adjustable.
They are.  There's a space between each link where the "teeth" of the 
locking head notch in.  Thus, each link is a possible locking point.

Also, (and this is not applicable to hard-core thieves who cart around
liquid nitrogen and oxy-acetylene torches) the cobralinks "LOOK" a lot
more effective than kryptonite cable locks (IMHO) and I think the initial
appearance effect is more relevant to bored-joyriders-nominally-adept-at-
cracking-unsecured-bike deterrence, as long as the lock is nominally 
functional.

Finally, I notice that when I ride with my leathers, harness boots, and
the cobralinks slung across like a bandolier (BTW, I've crashed in the rain
dressed like this and the lock didn't pulverize any vertebrae), cagers give
me a much wider berth, don't hassle me, and tend to avoid any potentially
inflammatory action at stoplights.

I love my cobralinks almost as much as I love my pre-80's Honda dinosaur.
(I think I have a pavlovian drool reflex-I put the lock on (i.e., on my
body) and I can feel the bike already shaking away).

My first post.  What did I do wrong :)?

p.s. any other CX500 owners out there?  Please e-mail me. Got 
questions about the weird handling on my bike.
