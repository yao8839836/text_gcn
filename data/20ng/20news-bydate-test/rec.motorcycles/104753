Yeah, it was one stupid little act.

When are people like you gonna get it through they're thick
excuses for a skull to their pea-sized piece of shit they
call a brain that it _was_ _once_?

who give you daily rim jobs and place your opinion where it belongs,
UP YOUR ASS!?

Or, alternatively, blow me, you closeted wannabe.
