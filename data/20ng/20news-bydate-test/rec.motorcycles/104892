good point.  the "list" actually started out as an extension of my GS
v. FJ shootout list, which is why it got that name.  since inception,
however, other boxer-interested folks have joined and the conversation
has not always been "geared" to gs/pd/st-specific topics.

when i raised the "to expand or not to expand/that is the question"
question on the list itself, there were mixed feelings.  the list has
always been open to anyone with a non-bouncing "from:" line and there
has been general agreement that only boxer-related stuff is
appropriate.  almost all of the subscribers own R80/R100 GS/ST/PD
bikes, although some R, RT and RS owners are also on it.

at this point, my main interest for the list is to preserve the peace
and comraderie while at the same time providing as wide access as
possible.  the list is fairly technical, with "how do i do this?",
"what kind of that should i get?" kinds of questions.  there has yet
to be any non-BMW bashing, K bike bashing, or "any bmw mfg'd after
1962 is a piece of shit" bashing.  such posts are, by consent of the
governed, proscribed.

if the simple name change would make a significant difference to the
net.boxer.owners, then i am not going to stand in the way of progress.

so, hesh, let me turn the question around: have you (or has anyone
else) not joined the list because you felt your boxer was excluded?
