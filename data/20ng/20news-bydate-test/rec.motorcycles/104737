About a year and half ago when I first started riding, I took a MSF course. I
have taken those lessons to heart.  Over the past year I have had only a few 
near collisions with traffic morons on four wheels.  Yesterday I got to add
another to the list but with this one I felt the most helpless.  I am sitting
at a light about 1 - 2 car lengths behind a car, a wise decsion.  Suddenly I 
hear screeching tires.  I dart my eyes to my mirrors and realize it's the 
moroon flying up right behind me, in my panic I pop my clutch and stall the
bike.  Luckily the guy stops a foot behind my rear wheel.

I understand why you theoretically stop so far behind a car but can you
really in actuality avoid such an incident?  Suggestions?
