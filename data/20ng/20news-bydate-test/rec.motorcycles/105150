Jim,

I hope you never drive (or ride) when:

you have been drinking 
you have been taking prescription drugs
you didn't get enough sleep the night before
you are upset with your girlfriend
you just didn't feel like your brain was talking to your body
you think you are at laguna seca and want to break the lap record

ANY of the above situations have the potential for harm (read death)
People make mistakesIf you have never endangered someone else by driving a vehicle in an
unsafe manner, then go right ahead and bitch about Mr Infante misuse
of a motor vehicle.  Otherwise, think about your OWN driving responsibilities.

I am sorry about the loss of your friends, but it could just as well
been the idiot who bought a Volvo because he has problems falling asleep at the
wheel.
