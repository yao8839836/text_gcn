 Grr. Hate the bastard who picked the weather for today.
 
 Went up to visit a friend overnight (about 45 minute ride).. rode up after 
work, only minor drizzing for the last 5 minutes of the ride... rest of the 
ride was very zen.
 
 Got up this morning, needed to go home and get some disks & stuff to work 
on her computers with, rainy as all hell. Soaked and cold by the time I got 
home.
 
 Since I didn't have another set of thermals which were dry, I said "to heck 
with it" and drove my cage back up.
 
 Lo and Behold, those funny blue clouds were up in the sky and this warm 
yellow thing I haven't seen in quite awhile showed up when I was 10 minutes 
into the trip.
 
 And me in my cage. Oh JOY.
 
 
 Happily, my right hand mirror finally showed up at the dealer (dropped the 
bike when I first got it, put on an EMGO replacement mirror... hated it the 
entire time that thing was on my bike because I couldn't see a DAMNED thing 
through it, plus it's flat instead of convex like the stock mirrors, so you 
get a NARROW ANGLE wobbly blur)... And I got a replacement windshield for my 
fairing (dropped the original and chipped the front edge... cosmetic but 
annoying)... so I spent half an hour happily unscrewing things and replacing 
them this afternoon.
 
 'Bout the only thing I still hate about the bike ('75 CB360T) is the damned 
"2 D-Cell Flashlight" headlight.
 
 Has anyone seen a good source for ~25 watt halogen passing lights? Since 
the charging system on the CB360T can't handle continuous use of a 50W 
halogen headlight, I was thinking about putting a couple passing lights 
on... that would give me ~70w of lighting for the rare night riding I do, 
but wouldn't drain the battery during "normal use" (chiefly day trips and 
commuting to work and back)...
