If your distance calc is correct for an "on the road distance" (and not
as the crow flies), this is 900km a day for 5 days.  If you spend the
entire time on interstates, which would be a total waste of time, that's
at least 8 hours on the road every day not including eating/peeing/
sight-seeing etc.

I was contemplating a similar trip, but from Ottawa to LA, or
maybe Ottawa to Austin Tx.  

I figured if I wanna do a trip of this magnitude and enjoy it, I'd
have to get my ass off the major Interstates and spend LOTS of
time enjoying the country around me; i.e. stopping with a camera,
meeting towns-people, going to a few bars.  No sense spending 2 weeks
looking out a helmet with the closest human contact found at the gas
pump.

I estimated I'd need at least 4-5 weeks to make the trip worthwhile.

Try and stay off the interstates!!!

Depending on your route and my plans, I may be heading that way as far
as at least Detroit.

Call the Whithorse Pess.  They're a book distributer catering to
Motorcyclists.  They have a large number of books highlighting
the best roads FOR MOTORCYCLISTS along the general route
you're looking at.  They carry listings of bed and breakfasts
all through the States which accept motorcyclists.  Order their free
catalog and within you'll probably find books covering absolutely
all you needs for this trip.  Their #'s in the Motorcyclist and/or
Cycle World classifieds.
