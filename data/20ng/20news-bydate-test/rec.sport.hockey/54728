According to the recent TSN report Peter Puck is not paying any interest
on the Treasury Branch loans.  That's a lot of green.

Again, according to TSN, virtually everything that Peter Puck has already 
has liens against it.  Of course we can't really be sure of this.

The Oiler rationale regarding the renegotiation of player contracts is
that a deal is a deal.  Sather has spouted this repeatedly.  Pocklinton
has a contract with Northlands until 1999.  A deal is a deal.  Perhaps
if he included the income he has received from his sale of assets (players
such as Gretzky) and the income he has received in expansion fees with
his revenues he wouldn't be losing money.  He has admitted pulling this
money out of the Oiler franchise to put into his other businesses.

I think that Pocklington has received ample provincial subsidization.  
I can't really blame him for going after municipal subsidization but 
he is certainly not entitled to it.  Pocklington has "sucked" revenue
out of the Oilers in order to prop up his failing business interests.
Pocklington is not to be trusted.  I doubt very much that any Oiler
team will ever again make the playoffs under Pocklington's stewardship.
As soon as a player shows himself to be a competent NHL'er and expects
to be paid accordingly he is shipped off for younger players and or
draft picks.
