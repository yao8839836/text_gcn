The Isles picked one hell-of-a-time to get their first win all year after being
down after 2 periods. The Caps seemed to have the game in hand playing steady
defense and getting great goaltending from Tabaracci. The Isles power play
philosophy continues to be dump-and-chase which, except for boardaholics like
Flatley, doesn't work against the Caps. I hope Al realizes this!! They have too
many talented finesse players, so why not carry the puck in and set-up??? If
last night's game is any omen, the Isles could be on their way to that ole
championship form; COMING from behind late in a game. My advice to the Caps is
to pounce on those Healy Rebounds. Flatley showed alot of heart by playing the
last period and overtime despite an almost swollen-shut left eye injury
suffered at the hands of Dale Hunter. Ray Ferraro has arrived just in time for
the playoffs showing the fiesty hustle that us Islander fans remember from an 
Italian from the past; JOHN TONELLI!!! It was Tonelli who won a similar game
against the PENS in game 5 on the 82 playoffs. The Isles scored two late third
period goals to send the game into OT tied at 3. In OT, Tonelli scored the game
winner to send the Isles to the next round. The Isles have lacked this tenacity
for years, but perhaps its BACK! It was good to see the Coliseum packed just
like the ole days!!! Good luck to the Isles the rest of the way!!!!!
