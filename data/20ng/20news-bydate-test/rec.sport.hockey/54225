Note that this ominous prospect is fueled by the fact that various SC
and Prime outlets are wholly or partly owned by local NHL owners.
When/If Cablevision VP Chuck Dolan's purchase of the Islanders goes
through, the Islanders will be back solidly in the SCNY fold (their
original owners were, and they've remained due to a lucrative TV
contract).  The Flyer Snyders own the Philadelphia SC as well as the
Prism pay channel.  There are six teams affiliated with regional SC's,
another half dozen affiliated with Prime outlets, and other locals
like HTS and NESN who have barter arrangements.  With all this
cross-ownership, I was surprised that ESPN got the deal this 
season!!
