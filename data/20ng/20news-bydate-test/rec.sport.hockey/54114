Hopefully EPSN will use the lesson given by the master: Ted Turner.
The season Ted introduced TNT, many cable co.'s refused to put it on,
saying that, gee we get enough old movies, miniseries, etc. on TBS,
USA, AMC, WGN, WOR, why do we need another one? This was in the fall.
Come spring, Ted fixed their little red wagons good. The previous
spring, NBA playoffs wore on TBS, now they were on TNT (and still are).
And everyone gets TNT now.

So, ESPN should put NFL football and baseball on ESPN2, and leave
hockey on ESPN. And if cable co.'s play games and drop ESPN
in favor of ESPN2, ESPN should alternate baseball and football between
channels every week.

But, do the ESPN guys collectively have the gonads of the Turner guy?
