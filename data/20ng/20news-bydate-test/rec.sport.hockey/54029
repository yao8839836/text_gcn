My sig has nothing to do with cockiness.  What you put in your sig has nothing
to do with your article, as I learned back in the fall, the hard way.

You mean 'butt' don't you?  Not but :-)

Sure you do -- what??????????

Two points, one what does r.s.b.c. have to do with hockey?  Secondly, UMASS
beat my Quakers???  Hello!!!  Earth here, are you responding???  We're not in
the Atlantic 10 (or 8 whatever you wanna call it), we're in the Big 10 now!!!
The A-10 was too weak for my Lady Lions -- they had to go to a more challenging
conference.  It didn't pay off as the Big East showed them a thing or too, but
I still posted on a regular basis and tracked all the women's scores with
reviews throughout the tournament.  It wasn't a reason to stop posting. :-)

>BTW.  Congratulations should go to the Sabres.  They are playing more

It's not over yet -- if anyone has a chance to come back in 4 games, I think
Boston can do it, but I still see Buffalo winning in 6.

>diciplined, and with more will to win.  They deserve it.

Agreed -- they're playing tremendous hockey right now.  Congatualtions on three
straight Buffalo.  It could very easily be 2-1 Boston, but Buffalo has come up
tough and a little luck.  (You never see a penalty in OT that doesn't have both
sides involved in a playoff game.  Never never never!)
