Perhaps it was the most exciting game played yet that YOU have seen.  For
most of us who watch teams around the league with interest and objectivity, 
it was *nowhere* *near* the most exciting game...

Unfortunately, the instant replay is not used on hits.  At first, I
immediately thought "5 and a game" because the hit _looked_ much more severe
from an intent-to-injure perspective than it was.  After seeing the replay,
I'd say it deserved 2-4 minutes for boarding (it was careless any way you 
slice it).  If Stewart had replay, I do not think Chaisson would have gotten
5 and the game.

This no-call was bullshit, I agree. I admire Stewart for letting them go, but
Probert *looked* *up* saying where the hell is the penalty?  I've never
seen Probert whine either (he doesn't need to).  Now, if Probie
decides to put Wendel through the boards, he's probably gone, right?

This was also bullshit.  But once again, no replay.  It was Rouse, btw. I'm
really pissed that the linesmen didn't correct the call either....it's b.s.
when the officials refuse to admit they made a mistake.  

>But, when it all comes down to it, [Wings played like shit.....]

Yes.  The calls you describe should not have the difference in a Detroit
loss.  I picked the Leafs to win Game 3 on emotion and adrenalin, but the
Wings have no excuses for Game 4.  They should be the superior team.

The call that pissed me off the most was Anderson getting 4 for putting his
stick in somebody's eye.  That was _the_ most dangerous stick infraction I
have seen in a long time, and everybody in the damn league _knows_ he's an
asshole when it comes to stickwork.  Four lousy minutes.  Bullshit call. 
Murray should send the tape in.  Or a Wing should hammer the living shit out
of him.
