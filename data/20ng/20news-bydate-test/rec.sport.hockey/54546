i'm not going to bother reprinting your pathetic excuse for a post. Mario  
fan, or not you have to respect what he can do with a blade. as for the  
hart trophy, i guess winning the scoring title after being out twenty-four  
days with CANCER, then leading his team to the presidents trophy and  
breaking the win streak record in the process shouldn't even qualify him  
for the award. maybe next year he'll tend a few games when barrasso needs  
a rest. be realistic, mario has earned every one of his accolades and  
deserves all the attention that he gets. lose the jealous attitude and you  
may start enjoying hockey at its finest
