 I'd like to echo these sentiments.  This is the worst coverage I can 
 ever remember seeing on CBC.  As soon as the game ends, I can count to 30,
 and by that time, they've signed off the air.  No post game interviews,
 no updating of late scores, nothin'.  TSN is really putting CBC to 
 shame.  I only hope the later round coverage improves, I mean, who
 really wants to see CBC PrimeTime News instead of hockey.

 My $.02,
  Darren
