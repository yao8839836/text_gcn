YAHOOOOOOOOO!

The Habs tied this sucker at 2 and the teams now head for Quebec
City to play game 5.  BTW, final score was Habs 3-Nords 2.

The score might be a bit misleading.  The Habs dominated the game
from the 5:00 mark of the first and then on.  The score should have
been 8-2 if it weren't for some miraculous save from a Ron Hextall
(bastard!).  He's the reason the score was as close.  Habs winning
goal was scored by Benoit Brunet at 1:07 of the 3rd.

Roy had an OK game.  He made the first save (one way or another)
and the defense was there to clear any rebounds.

This just in, ESPN radio reports that the Bruins lost 6-5 in OT.
YAHOOOOOOOOOOO!!!  Those suckers got what they deserved.

Life is just great!!!! Now if my finals would go just as well!
