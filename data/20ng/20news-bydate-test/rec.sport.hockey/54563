I think that Grant Fuhr deserves more credit than that!
While it's true that the entire Sabres team played very well, I
still believe that if it wasn't for Grant Fuhr, the series would
now be tied 2-2. He virtually stole games 1 and 3 for the Sabres.
In both of these games, Fuhr stood on his head to give the Sabres
the chance to win. Especially in game 3, Fuhr made a series of
huge stops in the third period when the score was tied 2-2. 
Even in game 2 when the Sabres won 4-0, the score seemed to
indicate that the Sabres dominated. However, if it hadn't been
for Fuhr, the Sabres wouldn't have been up (2-0 I think it was)
through the 2nd period and the Bruins wouldn't have had to open
up the game (thereby allowing Mogilny to score the third goal on
a breakaway to salt away the game).  There
is no doubt in my mind that Fuhr was the critical factor in the
victory. 

In my opinion, Neely, Oates and Juneau played as well as
LaFontaine, Mogilny and Hawerchuk. The Sabres did get
extraordinary efforts from Hannan, Sweeney, Wood, and Khmylev
(compared to that of the Bruins checkers). However, the Bruins defense
, IMO, played better than the Sabres defense (the Sabres have Ken Sutton
playing a regular shift afterall ;-)
The difference in the series was Fuhr, who outplayed Andy Moog.

Go Sabres!
