Heh... Try the rec.autos.sport FAQ. They are always calling ESPN to complain.
I'm sure you could find the number for ABC there too, as many west-coast 
viewers were compaining about how something as boring as hockey cut into
the Long Beach GP. =)

Were you (and several of the other people here it seems) asleep the day
"contracts" were explained? ASPN has a piece of paper saying it MUST
show that baseball game if it happens. Many businesses payedd money to
have their commercials run during a baseball game. This is a business,
not your own personal video servant.

Maybe you should put that anger into something positive. For example, I saw
ads for the new Dodge both on the ESPN and KBL broadcasts. Why not write to
Dodge saying that "thanks to the ads run during the STANLEY CUP PLAYOFFS, 
you will now concider their products in the future. They love to hear stuff
like that and in the future will be more willing to buy commercial time
for hockey games, giving ESPN (and other networks) more incentive to carry
games (just one example)

Come on people, as great as we think it is, Hockey does not leapfrog the
"big three" overight.
