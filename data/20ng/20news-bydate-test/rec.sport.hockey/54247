Yeh,but :

1.Biran Sutter's playoff record as the head coach in St.L wasn't very
impressive. His Blues teams were eliminated very early in the playoffs.
It doesn't look like this trend will change with the Bruins.

2. Bruins have never come back to win after falling behind 2-0 in their
entire 68-year history. It doesn't look like Buffalo will just lose
their next two games at the Aud with the way Fuhr has been standing on
his head.

Basically,the Bruins will be on the golf course by next weekend.
Also,it seems like the whole Boston area has gone baseball crazy after
an incredibly great start by the Red Sox(best record in their major
leagues as of now). I would say that 70% of the callers to the Bruins'
flagship station(SportsRadio 590) are talking about the Red Sox,about
15% are yapping about the Patriots' upcoming draft,10% are on the Celtics
and about 5% are on the Bruins.
Somehow,no one around here is really schocked the way Bruins are folding
early.
