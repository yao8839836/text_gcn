Do you notice that _nobody_ on the team is willing to take charge?
A dominant defenceman would be nice....too bad Schneider got hurt.
He reminds me of Chris Chelios sometimes.  Speaking of Chelios, I 
wonder if Serge Savard feels like a moron for making that trade.
I also wish we still had Corson.

Rob Ramage on the ice is less useful than a Gatorade bottle on the 
bench.

Vincent Damphousse has decided to take a vacation, apparently.  I have
no idea why Demers is playing Denis Savard on the checking line with
Carbonneau.  Savard is skating well, and is one of the only dangerous
Canadiens in Quebec's zone with the puck.  Too bad nobody is in front
most of the time.

Do you also notice that in the defensive zone, not a single Nordique
gets knocked down?  It's disgusting.  We also have Lebeau (5'10", 172)
getting pasted at centre ice by Wolaninn (6'3", 205) with no reply
from the team, except to yell for a penalty.  Dammit, Denis Savard 
threw the best (only?) Montreal hit of the night when he knocked
Sundin off-balance.  When Denis Savard is your team's enforcer, there's
big trouble someplace...

Aside from that second goal, Roy did stand on his head.  The third 
period at least provided something to look forward to.  Habs won the
period, IMO, and I guess somebody finally came along to smack them a
couple of times in the second intermission to remind them that a game
had started at 7:30.  Hopefully they play that way at home.  Roy made 
the saves (we'll ignore that second goal), so now it's up to the team.

P.S.  To all those Grant Fuhr doubters.....Buffalo 4, Boston 0.  
'nuff said.  And did somebody say Dale Hunter was a playoff choker?
I'd rethink that position :-)
