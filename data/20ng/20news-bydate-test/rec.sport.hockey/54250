	The Sharks appear to be leaning toward picking Rob
	Niedermayer, a center (his brother Scott (?) is a defenseman
	picked by NJ a couple years ago).  They brought him in for a
	physical/tryout a week or so ago. From what I have read
	Niedermayer is the best skater in the draft, plays BOTH
	offense and defense, and isn't afraid of physical play.
	Defensively the Sharks are looking pretty good in terms of
	defense prospects (Rathje, Sykora, Ragnarsson), and our
	centers (Kisio et al) are getting old.

	With all of the small players the Sharks have I justs CAN't
	see them picking yet another small player like Kariya, he'd
	just get bashed by the oppposition and get a separated 
	shoulder.
