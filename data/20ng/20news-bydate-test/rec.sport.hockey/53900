I can understand your anger about the German audience. I mean, it was the
Finnish team they played and they were taking advantage of the ridiculous
penalties the Canadien ref called in the last period. The Germans got a
match penalty and a 10 minutes misconduct for practically nothing and
seconds after that the German goalie got two minutes for "delay of game"
for a shot that was deflected and went into the crowd. The resulting 5:3
skating advantage lead to the deciding goal at a point, when the Germans
were starting to come up strong.
I am also sick of the nationalism that is going on in German sports events.
If you watch for example a tennis Davis Cup match the players are often not
able to play for minutes, because the crowd is so obnoxious. But I have to
admit that this kind of nationalism is as strong or even stronger in most
other countries (you should go to the US and watch the way they present the
Olympics on television; or the soccer crowds in England; or the Finnish
spectators at nordic skiing events.....). I mean it makes me sick to see
all this nationalism all over the world and I would rather see the best
team/player win and get cheared at. I do not mind if my favorite team
looses to somebody that is better or plays more attractive and I have to
admit that in most sports the German national site is not my favorite team
to watch (the German soccer team is boring to watch, for example).
But, reading the above posting, I think that you are on the same level as
these crowds you are criticizing. It is easy to talk of (nearly all)
Germans as Nazis and nationalists; thats the kind of propaganda that all
ultraconservative people use against Germany. It is true that there is a
great danger of re-arising nationalism in Germany but from my experience
most of the people (at least of the people that i know) also regard this as
a big threat and are trying to demonstrate this attitude now. Why can't we
just look at people as human beeings and not try to put them into drawers
corresponding to their nationality (eg. all Russians are Communists; all
Americans are Capitalists; all Germans are Nazis, all Fins are hanging
around beeing drunk on ferries...). 
In my opinion, your comment shows the narrowness of your mind and that you
don't seem to be different from the Nazis you are talking about.
