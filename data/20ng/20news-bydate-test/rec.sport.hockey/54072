All of these Czechs (Kadlec, Dolezal not anymore) are very good hockey
players. It is a big surprise that Hlinka selected Dolezal. 
"Dole" had a bad season in JyPHT and that's why they didn't make
a new contract. The other Czech we had, Jiri Jonak, got fired also.

There are lots of Czechs playing in Finland. Darius Rusnak, Igor Liba,
Sejba, Svoboda, ...
