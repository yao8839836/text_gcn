Prizes:
 
Prizes have not yet been considered. They could range from nothing to free
time on Hard Wired BBS or even something else (if you have any suggestions...
please feel free to put your two cents worth in).
 One idea is to get whoever is willing to to submit an equal amount of
money, and that will go to be the prize money.  The prize money will
go to the top team who has submitted to the prize pool.  A list
of all people who submit money will be posted, as well as those who
didnt - if it is done this way. 
Cost:
 
The cost... ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!!! There is absolutely no fee for this pool.
 
Note:
 
-If you have any questions, please feel free to send them to Denis Papp or
myself (Chris Stoochnoff). The players positions (ie. Brett Hull is Right
Wing) will be decided by the year book I will be using. So, if you do not
know a certain players position, or you are not completely sure what position
he plays, then ask me and I'll tell you.
 
-And for a great time, call the Hard Wired BBS at (403)-434-7996 (this will be
the location where the pool standings will be displayed).
 
Internet Users:
 
-To contact Denis Papp, just email (dpapp@muskwa.ucs.ualberta.ca). Standings
will be distributed by email as well.
