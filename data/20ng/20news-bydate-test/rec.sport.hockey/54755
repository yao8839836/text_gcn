This was a concession to Mansbridge and CBC News, they argued that if you're
going to play  havoc with the schedule, you should  at least make sure that
Prime Time is aired as soon as possible. News got a commitment that the
post-game show would be scrapped and that the network would go to PTN within
one minute or so of the game  ending.

As for the earlier comments about CBC being "Ontariocentric" frankly
the no doubleheader decison goes both ways, people in the West cant  see
the Leafs  and people in Central Canada can't see the Jets game. The
reason for the decision was CBC's feeling they couldn't sell advertising
for six hours of hockey in  one night.

 As for who wants to see news over hockey, a lot of people. CBC always gets
plenty of complaints about juggling the news schedule.
