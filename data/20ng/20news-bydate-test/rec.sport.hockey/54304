I am sorry to tell you this, but
I don't think the devils will win
a game against Pittsburg, the 
Penguins have so many scoring threats
that you shut down one and another
will kill you
It's too bad but I must conclude that the Penguins will
win their third stanley cup in a row.
I hope someone will beat them, but I just cannot see it
happening.
