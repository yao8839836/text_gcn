	In the Boston area, you can hear the Rangers on WFAN and the Devils
on WABC, the Whalers on WTIC and the Red Wings on WJR. This of course is in
addition to the Bruins who are currently on WEEI but may move to WHDH because
the fools at WEEI are owned by the Celtics and thus will show them over the
Bruins every time there is a conflict. You can also get WBAL Baltimore but
I don't think they have hockey. BTW, I once got a station from Indiana that
had Fort Wayne Comets games.
