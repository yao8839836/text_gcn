1) It fixes some problems with MicroProse games.  After leaving F-15 III it
would, in vain, try to find a floppy in drive A:.  This has been fixed.  I
don't know what other corrections were made.

2) It comes with an image of the original, in case things don't work.

3) Download glb05.exe.  Format a bootable floppy disk, and don't put a
config.sys or autoexec.bat.  Run the self extracting archive so all the files
explode to the disk.  Run the file fsh.exe.  It should be self-explanatory from
there.

P.S.:  I was feeling extraordinarily generous once again, so I uploaded the
file to ftp.cica.indiana too..
