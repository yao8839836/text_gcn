I've got an IN-2000 working in a (wimpy) 386SX20 presently.  In a few
months I'm getting a 486 motherboard and probably a Toshiba 3401e CDROM and
a SBPro.

Will I need special drivers for getting all this to work?  Do they exist?
Basically, is this feasible, or should I expect to be getting a newer, 
faster SCSI card?

thanks,
-Bryan
