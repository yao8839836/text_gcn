Les,

	I am right now working on an MPR-II certified (Swedish standards for
low emissions) Hitachi Superscan 15 monitor.  It's 1024x768, up to 72hz at
that res, and it got a good write-up for image quality in a recent (Feb.?)
issue of PC Magazine.  As far as I know, very little fully matches a NEC in
image quality (at least according to the mags -- I can't tell any
difference between the two!), but I think NEC is low emissions on only one
of the two types.  There's VLF (Very Low Frequency) and ELF (I think that's
Extremely Low Frequency).  The MPR-II standards set strict limits on both.
But many comapnies, NEC included according to one article I read (I get a
bunch of mags so it's hard for me to remember which!), which claim "low
emissions" but not specifically "MPR-II Compliant" or "MPR-II Certified"
only control for one, usually VLF, and ignore the other.
	So, the NEC probably has higher overall image quality (I consis-
tently hear it rated as the best or close to the best), but not as low
emissions as the Hitachi.  I like my image quality, but for all I know you
may be more discerning.  Good luck!

(Oh yeah: I got my Hitachi Superscan 15 from Insight for $499.)
