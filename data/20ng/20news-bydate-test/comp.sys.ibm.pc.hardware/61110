My PC is a 486-33DX (ISA) with AMI BIOS and OPTI chipset. I am thinking of replacing the AMI BIOS chip (dated 6-91) with an up-to-date one (not for any reason, just messing around). My questions are:

1. Do I just take out the old one and plug in a new?

2. Anything else I have to take care of? What precautions should I take?

3. Where can I get the new BIOS chip, CompUSA, mailorder or what? (I live in Orange County California).

4. What is the most up-to-date version?

5. Very important. How much would it be?

Thank you for your help.


Paul.
