What are peoples opinions on the above make of hard drives, I seem to have 
found a really good bargain on a 170meg drive but I thought I'd check if
anyone had any comments to say on this make?

Also I'm a bit of a novice with PC's (but an experienced computer user), when
connecting and fitting this drive into one of my spare 5 1/4 bays what extras
will I need, a cable for starters (I guess :-) , but what about brackets etc...

Also I think I might have to change some jumpers on the drive and my original
Connar 211meg one. I'll be attaching the second drive to a seperate IDE socket
on my controler card. What will I need to change ????

Yet again many thanks to all that have answered me in the past and to any that
answer me in the future :-)
