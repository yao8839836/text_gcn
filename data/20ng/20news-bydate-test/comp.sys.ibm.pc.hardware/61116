The VL-IDE Adapter can be much faster then the normal IDE, it depends on the
drive you use and the board you use. I am using a NoName VL-IDE I/O Contr.
it is tested under coretest with 2.000 kb/s using a cheap Seagate 3196 and nearly
4000 kb/s using a WD-Caviar 2340, you have figure out the jumper setting on the
controller to get reliable diskaccess, fastest setting gets 4600 kb/s under Coretest
but does not work reliable. You have to shadow the adapter BIOS to get the fast
speed. I haven´t used a VL-IDE-Cache controller yet, but it might speed up twice.
