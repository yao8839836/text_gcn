Greetings,

	I am looking to upgrade my hard drive to a much bigger
one since I find myself kinda cramped on space, althuogh I have never filled
it I would like the extra comfort of 30 megs or so.  If anyone would like
to sell/trade a newish 80 meg or bigger hard drive for 125 straight and
75 with a trade please e-mail me back at johng2matt.ksu.ksu.edu
with an offer.  I would also sell my hard drive for about 60$ if you
really want it.  it's a 42MB western digital IDE.  Other than that I am not
sure what the transfer rate is, but it is pretty fast. faster than my
roommates teac drive.  I have addstor running on it now and have had it
for about 5 months.  I have *never* had a problem with it and would guarantee
it works upon deliveree.  Thanks

p.s. I would love a maxtor 130 hard drive
