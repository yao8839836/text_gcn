    I am thinking about buying a new motherboard and a cyrix 486dlc 40 or 33 Mh
z.  It will be an upgrade from a 386sx 25.  I was wondering if anybody has any
FACTS they can fill me in on.  If anybody has one what do you think about it?
I will also get a cyrix math co with it.  I have benchmarks for the two chips a
nd they look very good for the price.  If anybody responds please send me email
 because I usually don't check the mail very often but I check my reader daily.
    Thanks for your info, and remember only respond if you have legitimate comp
laints or praise, not just to Cyrix/AMD bash.  I know about what Byte, computer
 shopper, pc computing and etc... have said and that is why I am considering
the Cyrix chip.  Thanks.........
