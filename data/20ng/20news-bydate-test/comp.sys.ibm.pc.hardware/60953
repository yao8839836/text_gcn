OK, here's my results so far....

1: You have to define the monitor as LCD - it doesn't really support
   Analogue video input (It works, but isn't very linear...)

2: The incoming sync pulses need inverting. This is best achieved
   with either a cmos XOR package or a transistor inverter.
   If you don't know how to do it, don't even contemplate it.. :-)

3: It'll only work in standard VGA mode.

OK, having said that, I'm trying to either find a circuit or IC
which will act as a universal sync decoder.

I want somethikng which basically only detects the leading sync
pulse edge, and doesn't care about the polarity, outputting
the -ve going pulses that the atari monitor requires.

There are 2 reasons for doing this

1: VGA cards change their sync polarity depending which mode they're
   in - herc emulation is +,- while MVGA is +,+ for example.

2: It means I don't have to put a toggle switch on the back of the
   monitor in order to be able to run it off both the atari and my
   IBM. Currently I have 3 (Yes, 3!) monitors sitting on my desk,
   and I want to get that number down as much as possible.
   Being able to use the atari monitor as a paper-white VGA
   will cut things down to 2. If I forget about Atari colour,
   I can get down to 1.

Ultimately, the best course of action is to get a multisync monitor,
but I'm as pressed for cash as anyone else, so it'll have to wait...
