Summary: Monitors listed in the April 1991 Computer Shopper
Originator: news@cbnewsf.cb.att.com
Nntp-Posting-Host: socrates.hr.att.com
Organization: AT&T
Lines: 190

Below is the list of large (at least 18 inches diagonal) monochrome
monitors which Computer Shopper lists as PC compatible.  I've omitted
Radius because Radius states that they no longer support the PC.

You will notice that Nanao is the only one which supports a 31.5Khz
horizontal frequency, which is the frequency normally used by VGA cards
at boot up.  My guess is that all the other monitors come with their
own graphics cards.  I've left voice mail with Nanao asking them to
send me some literature, and will report back to the net after I've
studied it.

The prices given appear to be list prices and have little relationship
to reality.
