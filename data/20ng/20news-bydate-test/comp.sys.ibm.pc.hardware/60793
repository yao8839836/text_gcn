I would like to know as well, since I just bought a 200MB Seagate IDE
drive and want to add it to my computer (a four-year-old Gateway
386/20), which currently has an 80MB Seagate SCSI drive.  The SCSI
controller is such that the docs told me not to specify it in the CMOS
setup, i.e. both hard drive settings are listed as "Not installed,"
and apparently the SCSI controller works its wonders.  I wondering if
this is a problem.  Also, I remember how, when I helped my cousin
install his second IDE drive, we had to define a master/slave
relationship for them; do I need to do something similar here?

>I am particularly interested in having the SCSI as the _boot_ drive.

Same here.

Any help would be appreciated, since I intend to install this drive
ASAP; I'd like to know what to do (and what not to do) before I start.
Thanks!
