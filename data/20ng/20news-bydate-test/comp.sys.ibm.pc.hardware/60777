Subject: 16bit DMA Failure - System halted.

I have a 486/50Mhz ISA Board with 256kbyte Cache and 16 Megs
RAM. I just bought the new soundblaster 16 and tried to 
install the card. The sb16 uses 16bit DMA channel.I could
select between channel 5 to 7. It is the first card I ever
installed that uses 16bit dma transfer. After I tested
the card the first time, the computer crashed and I got a
parity error-system halted. This happens either from dos as
also from windows. So it seems that my 16 bit dma channels
are not working properly (they are there because testsb16.exe
recocnize them and tests them ok until first access). 

Well, does anybody know a solution for this problem or a
special test program for dma problems? I eliminated the 
problem temporaly by using only 8 bit dma channel but it
makes the system slow!

Thanks for your help.
Yours Markus
