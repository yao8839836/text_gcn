is this the KX-P1124 you're talking about?  or is there a KX-1124, too?
I'll assume you just forgot the P....

this light is also the power light.....  on (not blinking) just means that
the power is turned on.  if you look at the panel, it should read

      POWER
      ---------
      PAPER OUT

right?

when you power up the printer, assuming it does have paper, the red power
