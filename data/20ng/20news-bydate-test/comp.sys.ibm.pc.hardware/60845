There is a software version of MNP-5 available from MTEZ, and it will often
connect with other modems that are MNP compatible, but if the modem that you
are connecting to doesn't support MNP then it won't help.  Error correcting
modems will eliminate line noise, but only id there are error correcting
modems on both ends of the conncetion.  The added soeed is much worth the
price of error correcting modems.  9600 baud V.42bis modems are very
reasonable, and they are only about 15% slower than the more expensive
14,400 modems on the market.

... My hard disk is full! Maybe I'll try this message section thing.
