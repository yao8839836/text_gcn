I bought a 386DX-40 motherboard for 50$... no documentation at all. Everything
appears to work, except I'm having trouble getting a few of the LED connectors
working. I've looked at the manuals for 4 other motherboards, but the pin
configuration doesn't look anything like what is on this board. Does this
pin arrangement look familiar to anyone out there??? Any hints on where I
can find this information?

                 1                 10
      "speaker"  . . . . . . . . . .
      "keylock"  . . . . . . . . . .
                 11          ^     20
                       J23   |
                             |The board came with a jumper vertically across
                              these two pins.

I can get the power/keylock to work across pins 11-15, reset across pins 9 and
19, but would prefer not to blow something up by further experimentation.
The date on the board itself is 6/92, opti chips.

I would really appreciate any help, and thank you in advance.
