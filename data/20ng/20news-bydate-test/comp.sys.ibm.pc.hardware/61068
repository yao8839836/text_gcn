hi folks
i have a 386 25 mhz and now i'm buying a new 486
first question) which is the best way to share hard disks
and printer
p.s. my two pc will be far about 10 meter and i like to use
a parallel port or ethernet card and i like to share resource
under dos linux os2.1 and windows 3.1 & nt

2) which 486? i think to buy 486 dx2 50mzh local bus
  but i heard that some board coulnd't work properly 
  cause some incompatibilites is that true?

  should a 486 dx 50 mhz a better solution

  in case i buy local bus it's better to buy an accelerated
  svga card with a normal local bus ide controller
  or it is better to buy a local bus svga card non accelerated
  with a normal ide controller?

  3)  is there any accelerated local bus and possibly true color 
      svga card? at which price?   
  4) i need to buy a cd which is the cheapest that is able to read
     musical photo kodak and computer cd rom
     i have heard about a sony and a mitsumi which is best?
     and which controller work with its?



     thank to everyone anserw me
