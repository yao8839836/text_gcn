hello all- i have a problem with my micro solutions backpack- sometimes 
it works, sometimes it doesnt.  i will either start a backup, or 
start a tape format, and at about 20 percent i get an error either saying
the tape is bad or the backup/format has aborted for an unknown reason.
if i turn everything off and wait a half hour it works fine.  is it
because the tape backup is too warm?  has anyone had similar experiences?


thanks,
kevin
