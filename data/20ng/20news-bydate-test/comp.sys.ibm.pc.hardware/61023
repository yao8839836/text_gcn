My 66 DX2 is about a week old and is custom built by me and for me.
I am using the PC Power and Cooling CPU Cooler.  This one has
precision ball bearings in the motor.  It has a pretty substantial
heat sink; so if it happened to fail it would still probably
dissipate more heat than the bare chip.

It attaches with peel off adhesive.  This is a full size AT case, so
the fan has gravity in its favor.  I would be a little nervous about
finding the fan at the bottom of a tower case if it happened to let
go.

All of the CPU fans that I know of are powered from a drive cable.
There are other "board" type fans which are ISA boards with a couple
of fans mounted on them.  They are powered by the slot.  I  don't
know how effective they are; maybe someone else could comment.

The cpu is cool enough to touch with the PCP&C unit.

PC-Connection at 800-243-8088 has them for 29.95 + 5.00 next day
delivery.  The Y cord is 7.00 if you don't have a spare lead off the
power supply.  PCP&C make the best power supplies available IMHO.
