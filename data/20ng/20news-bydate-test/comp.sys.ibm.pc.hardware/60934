I have a friend with an original HP LaserJet.  The nameplate does not 
specify a number, but since the LJ II followed later, one assumes that he 
has a LJ I.   His problem is a tax program which requires a 17 cpi font to 
print the forms properly.

This unit came to market in 2 versions.  The plus version supported 
dowloadable fonts.  You can guess which one my friend has - the plain, not 
the plus.  The printer does though have a slot and he has a small selction 
of cartridges including a 16.6 cpi - but none with a 17 cpi font.

Can anyone suggest a source for a cartridge with a 17 (or 18?) cpi font?  
Alternatively, is an upgrade to the plus version available at reasonable 
cost?

Any suggestions would be welcome.

Thanks
