I own a PC FanCard II, which is a slightly different beast.  It's a long card
that plugs into an 8 or 16 bit slot and contains two muffin fans.  It requires
no extra cabling.  I had a 286 that was experiencing some problems due to
heat.  The FanCard made the system run cool enough so that the problem no
longer appears.  It's supposed to keep the internal temperature in the range
of 75-95 degrees Fahrenheit.  According to the maker's (M.S. Tech)
advertisements, the US Army used a bunch of these to keep their PCs running
(w/o a/c) in Desert Storm.  I can't vouch for that.  However, I am a satisfied
customer.  And I have no other connection with the maker or the mail-order
house (Lyben  (313) 268-8100).

Hope this helps,

George
