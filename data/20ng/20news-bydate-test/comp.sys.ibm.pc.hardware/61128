Howdy,

I recently upgraded the original BIOS in a Compaq Deskpro 286/12
with a Phoenix replacement BIOS, in order to support an IDE hard drive,
and a high-density 3.5" floppy.

I assumed that this would be a plug-and-play procedure, but I have
encountered a problem that Phoenix and Compaq are unwilling to admit
responsibilty for, and I was wondering if anyone else had seen it.

Everything is hunky-dory except the 3.5" floppy, which will read, but NOT
WRITE diskettes.  Any write attempt merely corrupts both FATs.

I have tried everything I can think of.

Any takers?
