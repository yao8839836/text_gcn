I need info regarding a miniscribe 3.5" half-height drive. There is a
sticker on it with the following,
    MODEL   HDA    PCBA   UNIQUE   TDA
    8425F   09AA   03AB   03AA     -
But the sticker on the biggest chip on the MFM interface has this,
    MODEL   PCBA   TDA
     FXX    03AB

What is the spec of the drive (# of cyl, heads, etc)?
How fast is this drive? Can I use it as a RLL drive? 
I also have a SCSI interface that seems to match all the connectors
for this drive. It has this description,
    MODEL   PCBA   E-P   TDA
     AXX    01A    29A
Can I replace the MFM interface by the SCSI interface and use the drive
as a SCSI drive? What would the drive size be? There is a set of jumpers
on the SCSI interface with "6SEL" besides it. What is the use of it?

Could someone also send me specs for Seagate ST4096 (5" full-height) drive?

Thanks
