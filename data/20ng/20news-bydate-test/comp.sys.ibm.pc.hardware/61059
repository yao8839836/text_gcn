Hi peeps,

Here's another of those "any ideas" type queries.

I've been given an oldish Phillips TeleVideo terminal type thingy, without
a keyboard.  But no problem so far.

When I dismantled it, I discovered that it is really just a standard
RGB monitor with built in modem/ROM software etc.

Phillips kindly labelled the circuit board with the RGB inputs, so I
connected it up as a monitor and he presto it worked - sort of.

The problem is that I have no idea where to connect the Sync lines.
The display rolls continuously, but does change modes (OK only to
CGA - but useful for my laptop).

Any of you wonderful people any knowledge of Phillips monitors?

I've tried Phillips in the UK and a very helpful guy told me that
he has had several enquiries of this sort, but Phillips Computer
is now under the auspices of DEC (at least in the UK).  DEC said
sorry Phillips don't make it any more. What is it anyway?
A UK support dealer said "Circuit diagrams? Sync?"

So any ideas.

John.
