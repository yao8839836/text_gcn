Yes, they are nice ads, and even better: great prices.  But this is all on 
the outside.  The consumer sees this and orders.  Little do they know, they 
will get *POOR* service (very poor).  When I ordered a 105mb hard drive from 
TC about 6 months ago, I received it in the mail, installed it, and 
discovered it DIDN'T WORK!!!  I sent it back to them, and they said they'd 
send me a refund check.  IT TOOK MANY, MANY, MANY phone calls and hate-mail, 
as well as threats of lawsuit to get back my $250.00!  In fact, it took TWO 
WHOLE MONTHS of calling and threatening!  Every time I'd call, I would be 
put on the run-around until I finally wound up on an answering machine.  I'd 
leave my name and phone #, but I didn't even get called back *ONCE*.  I AM 
ONE PISSED OFF T.C. CUSTOMER, 	AND IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GET RIPPED OFF, OR 
IF YOU WANT DECENT SERVICE, DO NOT --I REPEAT-- DO NOT BUY FROM THIS 
COMPANY.  THE MONEY SAVED IS NOT WORTH THE ULCERS YOU WILL GET.  PASS THIS 
WORD AROUND TO YOUR FRIENDS.  		Companies like this do not deserve 
to stay in business, so let's not give them out hard earned money.  

Discount Micro, Systems Powerhouse, and Gateway 2000 all have given me 
excellent service and speed in the past.  I highly recommend them to anyone.
