I'm using Norton Cache 5.0, which is really nice but horrible incompatible.
Some games won't work it, my streamer software won't work with it and Windows
doesn't like it at all. But when copying or deleting lots of small files, only
NCACHE is really fast. You see, to write a file the FAT must be changed. But to
write 1000 files the FAT must be changed only once. Is there any cache program
out there which is smart enough to do the same and good enough to run with all my
applications? Any help is really appreciated.
