I originally posted a complaint about how noisy my PC was. I got several 
useful suggestions, but 1 was the most seductive: run your PC in silence by 
removing the fan altogether!

Two variables: 
1) I always run my PC without the cover, and 
2) I'd be willing to attach a CPU cooler if that would make a difference.

Should I try to run my PC without a fan? I know it sounds like utter folly so 
I'm asking - has anyone done this succesfully? Or tragically? You're answer 
may save my PC... Thanks.
