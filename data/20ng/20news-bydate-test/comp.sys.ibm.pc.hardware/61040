| The April 13 issue of PC Magazine published benchmarks for the ATI UltraPro
| running on both VLB and EISA:

| 	800x600,16	800x600,256	1024x768,16	1024x768,256
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------
| EISA	15.34		15.34		15.19		15.15
| VLB	16.02		16.31		16.33		16.24

This a wightened speed avarage for many windows tasks. The original
poster (Ross Mitchell) was primary intersted in manipulating large
images, which implies moving a lot of data from memory to the card. 

Does anyone have the benchmarks on this particular task?
