 GSB> a 286 upgrade would probably cost about $50, 386 about $150 or so.  
 GSB> Coprocessors or accelerator cards would cost at least that much.

'Tis true!  I just saw an add for 286/20 motherboards for $80.  I have seen
whole 286/12 systems, complete with case, power supply, keyboard, floppy,
and mono card/monitor going for $250.
