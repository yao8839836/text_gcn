Call Phoenix.  They can put you on line with replacement BIOS chips.  I had
to do this when I upgraded a Emerson 386/20 to an IDE drive.

Also, if you are installing an IDE drive, and there is a BIOS setting that
has a total volume the same as the IDE drive's volume, try using it.  The
IDE drive can usually respond to a variety of different geometries, as long
as the setting that you use is equal to or smaller than the drive's actual
size.  The controller will do the necessary translation automatically, in
most cases.

WARNING!!!  Do not use a BIOS setting that is even one byte larger than the
actual size of the drive!  A smaller setting will not harm the drive, but
you will be sorry if you go even one byte over.  Drive damage will not
result, but headaches will!
