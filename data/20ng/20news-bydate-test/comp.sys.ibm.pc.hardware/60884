Having in mind the size of the images, my opinion is to go with VLB.
It has _much_ more bandwith that EISA, which in fact can be utilized
by the craphics card. (I have not made measures, so someone else may
share experience on that.)

Also, the DX2/66 is faster in the operations, that run off internal
cache, slightly slower off the external and about the same off memory.
So my advice is the 66/VLB.

| We're quite happy with the ATI card - very fast, ONCE the data gets to it!!
| ~Slow~ repainting images under PhotoStyler that have moved off screen, or
| been uncovered!  

| There doesn't seem to be enough raw cpu when running DesqView/X!  Its sluggish

| a long time (even when the images fit entirely in ram).

| There's not enough memory in the system - DesqView/X and a 1 meg SmartDrive

Have You tried running Photostyler without the cache? No need to have
paging and cache both. (Well, you might argue, that the paging is
cached). My belief (no measurements) is that apps left with more
memory will manage it better than smartdrv.exe(sys).

| transfer rates to 160k/sec - still very slow (especially when moving large 
| images).  Is there such a thing as a local-bus ethernet card coming??  Will it
| make a difference?  I'm hoping so, and leaning towards the 486DX2-66 choice 
| (above), for that reason.

The bandwidth (theoretical) of ISA is over 5MB/s, which is far from
0.15MB/s. I tried my ISA IDE hard drive (Maxtor 213MB) and got the
same results - 0.65MB/s - regardless of the ISA bus speed
(5.5-8.25MHz). So I guess, that just the card/drivers combination is
lousy.

| Also, are there DX2-100's on the horizon?  What about DX3-99's?  DX3-150's ???!

The rumors are that DX3-99 (if any) is the most likely chip to come
out. But note, that IBM is closest to the technology an it will only
sell whole motherboards, so you'll have to upgrade the MB.

| Any information is greatly appreciated.

Just some view, not much figures.
