Give the new Viewsonic 17 a good look.  I have seen it side by side with
an old Viewsonic 7, a MAG 17, a Nanao 17" (not the Trinitron one), and
a Sony OEM 17" (which does have a Trinitron tube).  The new Viewsonic
beat all of them easily in terms of picture quality, and I think it is
far superior to the 16" Sun that I am staring at now.  The place asks
$1178 for it; I would have bought it if I had not just bought a 15"
Nanao F340iw a week earlier :(
