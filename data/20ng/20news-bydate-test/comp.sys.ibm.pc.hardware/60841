LPT ports don't recognize baud, parity, etc. settings.  You might be tring
to connect a serial printer to a parallel port.  Try this: attach the serial
port of the printer to a serial port on the PC.  Use the mode command to set
the COM port settings.  Try

C>MODE COM1,9600,N,8,1

to set the port parameters.  Then use the MODE command to redirect the
printer port LPT1 like this:

C>MODE LPT1=COM1

This should work.  Good luck!
