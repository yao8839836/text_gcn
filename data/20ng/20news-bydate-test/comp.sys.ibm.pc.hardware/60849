Is it possible to put more than 1 controller in a PC.  By this I mean of 
different types.  ie.  RLL and MFM.  If so how do you access the drives
in the CMOS setup.  Do they just show up to be configured or do you 
have to do low level writes to the controller.  

As an example put 1 RLL controller with 2 drives in a machine.  Put
a MFM controller and 2 more drives connected to it.  I now have 4
drives with 2 controllers of different types.  Also can you 
put 2 controllers of the same type into a PC and again how do you access 
them.  

I was asked this question and never tried to do it so if anyone has
done this and can supply me with info I would very pleased

Thanx in advance for any info...
