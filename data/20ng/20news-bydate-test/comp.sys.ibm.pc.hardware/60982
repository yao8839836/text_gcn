        I am considering selling an Atari 1040 and purchasing an IBM compa-
tible.  I need to know what kind of money or trade I can expect to get for
the Atari before I bother.  I am about to start graduate school, and that
means I'm about to be poor!  (There's a price list for used synthesizers on
rec.music.makers.synth, but no equivalent list for computers...)

This system is tailor-made for a MIDI musician.  Details follow:

  * Atari 1040 ST
      TOS 1.0
      1 MB RAM
      720K floppy drive

  * SupraDrive 20 Mb external SCSI drive, 18 months old

  * 12" Atari monochrome monitor

  * Generic 2400 baud external modem

  * Software: All software is registered and comes with manuals.
      Passport's Master Tracks Pro, Version 2.5 (sequencing software)
      Dr. T's Copyist Professional (scoring software)
      First Word (word processor - *not* the PD version)
      Megamax's Laser C, Version 2.0 (programming language)
      VIP Professional (spreadsheet package - low-tech Lotus clone)
      Partner ST (desk accessory with integrated calendar, cardfile, etc.)
      Migraph's Easy Draw (an early, pre-Postscript release)
      NeoDesk (improved desktop for Atari ST)
      Universal III (improved file selector for Atari ST)
      Miscellaneous software (including Uniterm communications software)


        I will consider all prices above $900.  I am also willing to
trade the Atari system for a quality (386 or 486) PC, including lap-tops.
I own some PC hardware, so a complete system may not be necessary.
