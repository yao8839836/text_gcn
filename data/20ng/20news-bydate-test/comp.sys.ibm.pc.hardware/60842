*** On 04-21-93  04:30, Michael Shapiro had the unmitigated gall to say this:

 MS> The DOS system date has a twenty-four hour clock and a rollover bit.
 MS> When the system crosses midnight, the rollover bit is turned on.  
 MS> Subsequent reads of the time add one.  There's no change possible

 MS> (This information was current up through DOS 3.3.  I've not checked to
 MS> see whether it applies to later versions.)

Just a small tidbit: with the advent of DOS 3.3 and later versions, MS added
a small "feature" to the DOS time function.  If a program sets the DOS clock
via DOS system services, then DOS will set the BIOS clock to the same value.
This breaks the isolation between the two clocks that used to ensure that
errors in the DOS clock did not bleed over into the BIOS clock.

Sometimes the Microsoft people just don't think! :)
