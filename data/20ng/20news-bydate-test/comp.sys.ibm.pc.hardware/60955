I asked for opinions yesterday on Gateway machines. All
the e-mail I received indicated that they were solid,
reliable machines and technical support was very good.

Well, Gateway faxed me a price sheet just now. It seems
to be on the higher side, but then again, maybe not.
Dell's price for a similar price is a whole lot more.
Is this a decent deal? Please advise via email! 

		       $DX-33V
  80486DX 33 MHz
  Desktop case
  64K SRAM cache (20 ns)
  8MB DRAM(70 ns SIMMS) expandable to 64MB
  1.2 MB and 1.44 Epson diskette drives
  250 MB Western Digital IDE (13 ms) 17Mb DTR
  Local Bus IDE interface
  ATI Ultra Pro VL bus with 1MB VRAM and 24 bit drivers
  15" CrystalScan 1572FS color monitor
  Phoenix BIOS

  Please advise! 


  Thanks!
