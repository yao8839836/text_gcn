My 486DX2-50 has 8MB of 70ns RAM and a Trident SVGA card. Sometimes I feel it
runs very slowly, especially when running Windows.

I'm planning to buy an ATI Graphic Ultra + next semester. Is that all I need
to get the problem solved? Is 70ns RAM chips too slow for my machine? Do faster
RAM chips make a big difference?

I use CAD software on my computer as well. Do those up-grades good enough to
speed it up a lot? Any one experienced the difference between ISA bus and VL bus(both with a graphic accelerator)?

(A SCSI controller may not be appropriate, since I may have to replace my hard
disks as well. However, sometimes I do have huge files on my computer. Does



it really worth to use a SCSI interface? I can't spend too much on  it)

Any help will be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

p.s. Man! I hate the stupid text editor. Is there any way I can type my article
in a DOS word-processor and load the file into usenet?

Thanks in advance again!
