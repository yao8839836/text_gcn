The temp on my 486DX2/66 is over 96C (measured with a K-type thermocouple 
and Fluke 55 dig thermometer).  This is an "idle" temp - not doing lots of
bus i/o, not doing floating point, not doing 32-bit protected mode etc.  This
is in a Micron computer, without heatsink.

I recently put a heatsink/fan on the chip, but I might take the fan off.  It
makes a horrible whine at times, and I wonder what the vibration is doing to
the pins on the cpu etc...

Rob,
Don't worry about the whine of the fan it will go away in about 3 weeks
of use, mine did...
As to the vibration well that something I thought about to as I have
a tower case and the mb is mounted vertically. So I mounted the fan
on the case so that it just blows air at the CPU and its heatsink
instead. Work just like a charm, but the realy biggy to think about
is after the whine goes away on the fan. If the fan should stop (burn out)
how would you ever know this before the cpu goes up in smoke. Thats what
you should be thinking about. I have the parts together but have not
had the time to assemble them as yet. But you build a thermistor controlled
circuit that will turn on a pesso speaker and a LED when the temp. goes
above the normal operating range (96c) or there abouts. Cheep to do if
you use Radio Shack junk under $5....Think about that one for a while!
