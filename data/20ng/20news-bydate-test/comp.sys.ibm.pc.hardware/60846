Just a wild thought here, but how about this: there is a small boot program
on every formatted diskette, whether or not it contains system files.  It is
this small program that prints the "Non-System Disk" error, not DOS.  If
this program tries to transfer control to a BIOS location that is
nonstandard on the Gateway, then it could clear the BIOS.

I don't think that the BIOS is overwritten, there is usually a small routine
to clear the CMOS area, in case an invalid configuration prevents the
machine from booting.  I think that the boot code on the Fuji disks may
inadvertantly call this routine.

Just a thought.
