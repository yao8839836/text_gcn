I have a floppy drive which has developed "General failure" errors. (It's a Teac 1.44Mb 3.5" drive).

I took it out of the machine and noticed it was very dusty. I used a high powered air can to blow all this dust out and it's quite clean now.

However, it didn't help the problem.  I've also identified that when the machine boots (and the drive seeks for a boot disk), the head movement during this process is now approximately half the length of the original time.  What I mean is the period when the drive light comes on and the heads move from their retracted position out to the track containing the boot sector.

Is there anything more I can do to try and save this drive? I'd prefer not to shell out $100 for a new one if I can help it.

Thanks!

Cheers, Ben
