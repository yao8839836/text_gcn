Quantum LPS240A hard disk phantom seeks

I just purchased and installed a 240MB Quantum 3.5" hard drive, model
LPS240A, and have a concern about its behavior.

Although the disk drive itself seems to behave properly with respect to
file I/O, it performs what I call phantom seeks.

When the PC is absolutely idle, I can hear a spurt of activity in the
drive every 30-40 seconds, lasting 1-2 seconds. This activity seems to
be initiated strictly within the drive itself since the disk LED never
comes on. [The disk LED is attached to the disk controller card, not
the drive.]

My other hard disk, a Seagate ST3283A, does not have this kind
behavior.

Can anyone comment on this strange phenomenon?
