I do not have specific knowledge of Lap-Link or Telix, but my recommendation
for ANY package is to follow each one's instructions for making the null-
modem cable.  The reason is that each one may be different since there isn't
really a standard for PC to PC communications.  The following is a tutorial
I wrote up that will give you an understanding about RS-232 and null modems,
but you should still check your software!

I will eplain a couple of details of RS-232.  RS-232 is
a commumications specification for communicating between a computer and a
modem.  Actually it can be between any end system and any communications
hardware.  The terminology used is Data Terminal Equipment (DTE) and DATA
Communications Equipment (DCE).  RS-232 spells out the voltage levels, the
connector type, the pinouts, and the signal protocols.  The connector is
a "DB-25" but IBM has set an alternative "standard" of DB-9.  The primary
signals are Transmit Data (TD), Recieve Data (RD), and Signal Ground (SG).
There are other signals that provide control between the DTE and the DCE.
For example, the DTE announces that it is powered up and ready to participate
in communications via the Data Terminal Ready (DTR) signal.  DTR is an
output on the DTE and an input on the DCE.  Similarly, the DCE announces that
it is ready to participate in communications via the Data Set Ready (DSR)
signal.  DSR is an input on the DTE and an output on the DCE.  Ok that's
five signals; there are only four more of interest.  The Request To Send (RTS)
signal is an output from the DTE (and an input to the DCE) that is used
to ask the DCE permission to send data.  If the DCE agrees, it sends an ok
via the Clear To Send (CTS) signal.  (For completeness, the CTS is an input
to the DTE and an output from the DCE).  The other two signals (of interest)
are Ring Indicator (RI) and Data Carrier Detect (DCD).  These are both inputs
to the DTE and outputs from the DCE.  RI is just what you would expect -
a signal to the DTE saying that someone is attempting to establish a connection
to the DCE.  This is rather specific to the modem / telephone line setup.
DCD is a way for the DCE to announce that the "connection" has been established
i.e. the local DCE is talking to some remote DCE.  There - that's it.  Oh
there are many other RS-232 signals defined, but they are obsolete.  I have
explained the nine signals that are on a PC.  The pinouts are as follows:

Name    DB-9     DB-25
 SG       5        7
 TD       3        2
 RD       2        3
DTR       4       20
DSR       6        6
DCD       1        8
RTS       7        4
CTS       8        5
 RI       9       22

Now to address your problem at hand.  When you connect a PC to a PC (a DTE
to a DTE), there is no DCE pair in the middle and therefore the RS-232
signal definitions don't work out quite right.  There is no DCE to assert
the CTS, DSR, DCD, or RI.  So the common thing to do is to not use these
signals at all - and also forget about the DTR and RTS outputs as well.  If
this is done you simply make a null modem (a cable) that passes through SG,
and crosses TD and RD (i.e. pin 2 of one end connects to pin 3 at the other
end, etc).  The problem with this solution is that a PC that wants to send
data has no way of knowing if the other PC is ready.  It would have to just
send the data and hope it got through.  Therefore a better null modem would
include the DTR/DSR pair crossed.  A particular point a confusion is in the
software area.  Just because you run the wires does not mean that the soft-
ware will use them.  If you are using the built-in BIOS to control the
serial port, then the BIOS dictates what wires you need and how they are to
be used.  But if you have a comm. package such as Brooklyn Bridge, or Lap-
Link or Telix, then those packages dictate the cabling requirements.  The
only thing you can guess reliably is the SG, TD, and RD.  The DTR/DSR is also
fairly common.  There is one more issue that needs to be addressed here.  And
that is flow control.  In the RS-232 scenerio, the DCE's are responsible for
flow control and it is assumed that the DCE couldn't possible over-run the
DTE.  By this I mean that as long as the DTE has its DTR line asserted, the
DCE will send data - without requesting permission first.  Note the contrast
to the other direction of data flow: the DTE must request permission by
asserting the RTS line and it must wait for the CTS signal before it can
send.  And now in the DTE to DTE scenerio, the question is do you need flow
control?  The answser is usually.  But how?  For non-binary communications,
one common technique is XON - XOFF which is implemented in software - no
wires are dedicated to flow control; the TD and RD carry the XON and XOFF
commands.  This type of flow control can be used in addition to hardware
flow control, but the problem is that you can't send binary data because
your data might include the XON or XOFF codes and cause erroneous conrol
signals.  (A work around is to have the software insert and extract "escape"
codes, but the hardware flow control is prefered).  The problem with hard-
ware flow control is that there is no standard.  There are lots of ways to
do it and I bet they have all been tried.  One cornerstone of all the methods
is to use the RTS/CTS for one direction.  But beyond that anything is fair
game.  Again, you must look to you comm package for cabling requirements.
But I bet you'll find that one cable (if wired properly) could work with
all of the packages as long as they are of the same vintage.  By the way,
I am familiar with one package that uses RTS/CTS and DTR/DSR for flow control
the RTS is request to send and the DTR is ready to recieve, the CTS is the
clear to send and the DSR is the request to recieve.  This does not mean a
differnt cable - it is just software.  The clincher to all of this cabling
stuff is that it is common to have the UART directly controlled by the CTS
signal which means that the CTS must be present even if you are not support-
ing it in software.  For these cases you will find cables that short the
RTS to the CTS at the same end (or perhaps the DTR to the CTS).  Other
possible shorting might be done just because the software expects certain
signals that you don't have (or don't feel like providing because it would
mean additional wires).  Specifically I am talking about the DSR.  Shorting
the DTR to the DSR is not a good idea in general but you may find cables like
this.  It is a bad idea because it defeats the whole purpose.  One more
"gotcha" signal is the DCD.  Some software (including the PC BIOS) expects to
see the DCD before it will work.  This signal sometimes gets shorted with the
DTR.  But my favorite null modem has the RTS and CTS shorted at each end, but
the RTS is also connected through to the other end and connected to DCD.  And
of course the DTR/DSR are crossed as are the TD/RD and of course the SG must
pass through.  This null modem works with most software.  The flow control,
if any, can use the RTS/DCD with the DTR/DSR.  If your comm. package does not
specify the cable required for PC to PC connection, then I suggest you use
this one.
