Wrong, it has a 6507.

It had one custome chip (not an ASIC in the sense that word is now understood):
the TIA (sometimes known as the 6526, although most other manufacturers list
that as the CIA complex interface adapter.)  TIA stands for Television
Interface Adapter, and it handles sound, paddles and the minimal video hardware
the 2600 possessed.

There was also a standard 6532 RAM, I/O, Timer (RIOT), plus a voltage
regulator and (if memory serves) a 555 timer.  That's all.

Not according to the servicing documentation I have here.  The 2600 did not
change intenally very much at all.

ROMS were mapped into the upper 4K of the 6507's address space.  2K and 4K
games were fine, but later 8K and 16K games needed bank switching.  Atari
(and others) made much of these "huge" cartridges.

Wrong, it had 128 bytes of RAM from the RIOT.  This was multiply mapped into
both page 0 (pseudo-registers) and page 1 (stack), and also throughout the
bottom 4K of memory.  TIA registers also sat in this address space.

As 128 bytes of RAM was somewhat limiting, some later cartridges also carried
RAM themselves, which was interesting as Atari had provided no write line
to the cart.  This was managed by mapping the reads from RAM into one address
range, and the writes into another, but all the time this scheme ate into
the *very* scarce ROM address space.
