True, which is why many of the newer keys ship out, oh, maybe 32 bits or
so, have the key encrypt them, and return them to the PC.  Making a bunch
of these 32 bits part of your program code is a good way to make sure
things won't run without the key. :-)  Anyway, then, this scheme at least
defeats your approach.  It's a little costly, though.

Personally, I don't believe in copy protection, and agree with the thought
that the mass inconvenience that it causes all legal users far outweighs
the gains from what few pirates won't be able to copy the program.
