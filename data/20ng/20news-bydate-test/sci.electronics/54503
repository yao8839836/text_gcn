Sorry about following up my own article, but I wanted to continue
that what might be being missed here is that the important thing
might not be temperature differences per se, but the action of
heat sinking the battery.

Perhap someone could conduct an experiment, taking two identical
lead acid batteries, placing both on wooden shelves, but putting
one of them in a water bath designed to act as a heat sink.  This
would eliminate the 'concrete floor effect', and keep both batteries
at the same ambient temperature.

I think the argument over temperatures is not pertinent, but the
one over heat conductance and removing the exothermic heat may have
some validity.
