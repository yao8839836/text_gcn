More than Talk:  From the FCC Rules:  73.4250 Subliminal Perception:

(a) See Public Notice, FCC 74-78, dated January 24, 1974, 44 FCC 2d, 1016; 39
Fr 3714, January 29, 1974.
(b) See FCC Information Bulletin, "Subliminal Projection" (sic, at least in my
rules service copy of the rules), dated November 1977.

Since I don't have either old copies of the Federal Register or the Information
Bulletin around, I can't tell you what you can't do on TV ( or radio) but I
seem to remember this being an unnecisarily hot subject in the late '70s. 

Practically speaking, I dont have too much trouble seeing the one frame edits
in MTV promos,  badly scratched or torn single frames in films and such, but
maby that's just because the contrast between the single frame and the
surrounding material was significant.  I never believed in the one-frame type
of SP being real.  

On the other hand, the Coca-Cola or Brand (insert desired name here) beer cans
conveniently placed so the brand name is visible in the movie you just watched,
that's another story, and if your TV station or network was paid by the beer
company for the privilege of doing that, there has to be a "Promotional
Consideration paid by ...) or similar message included with the program; but if
the TV station bought the movie already edited that way from the film company
and didn't get any of the payment for "brand visibility" that the film company
got, then they don't have to run the message.
