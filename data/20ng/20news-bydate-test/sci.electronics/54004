I would like to hook up some cameras that were recently donated to our
local community cable TV station which have sync inputs in the form
of horizontal and vertical drive. Our station sync is a black burst
which works fine with other boxes with "genlock" style inputs. Can
anyone point me at a design, article, or whatever showing how to produce
the horizontal & vertical drive signals? Thanks in advance.
