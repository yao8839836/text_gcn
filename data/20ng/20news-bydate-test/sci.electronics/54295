I've come across a circuit from Integrated Circuit Systems Inc
called a GSP500.   This chip genlocks a VGA card to a dual input
NTSC signal.  
The output from this chip is basicly a pixel clock, and has various 
speeds.  I notice that it outputs a 28mhz clock..  can this output be 
used on an Amiga system?
And must it be NTSC/VGA  or can it be NTSC/NTSC  ?
 
Any simple circuits to boost an NTSC to a VGA signal?
Need to genlock a laser disc to my 31khz video.
