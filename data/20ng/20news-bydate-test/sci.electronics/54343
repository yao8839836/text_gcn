AS IT HAPPENS, YOU'VE HELPED ME QUITE A BIT. I'M CONSIDERING BUILDING
A VERY SIMILAR DEVICE JUST FOR SOMETHING TO DO THIS SUMMER.
THE IDEA IS TO CODE THE 8 OUTPUT BITS INTO MULTIPLE 2-BIT 
CURRENT-AMPLIFIED OUTPUT CHANNELS.  SOFTWARE WILL HANDLE THE WAY THE 
AMPLIFIED OUTPUTS ARE MANIPULATED SO THAT THIS MAGIC BOX CAN HANDLE
MORE APPLICATIONS THAN JUST STEPPER MOTORS.  ALSO LOOKING FOR A ROBOT ARM
(CHEAP) TO ATTACH THIS BOX TO SO I CAN WOW AND IMPRESS MY FRIENDS.
    ANY HINTS?       PETER J DEMKO ME170PJD@UVM.EDU
