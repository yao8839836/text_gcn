        Yes, it is possible.  I'm making a 7 stepper controller board, 
with 7 digital inputs, and (up to) 18 digital outputs from the // port.
   One main thing that will tell you whether the // port is 
bi-directional or not is the bus tranceiver on it.  Look for a chip 
numbered 74LS245.  If you don't have this, then it's probably a 74LS244, 
which will do you NO good for reading in.
  
          Now, if you do have the '245 then do the following:
  First, find the address of the port, (decimal) either 888, or 632.
  In pascal, you would "Write(Port[xxx]);" where xxx is the address in 
either hex or decimal.  The status lines, pins 14, 16, 17, as well as the 
strobe, pin 1, are bi-directional lines, and are read by base address +2, 
so for 888, to read from status, then read from 890.  You can also output 
to these lines in the same fashion as to the data lines.  In pascal, 
do "Port[xxx]:=value
".
 
                Hope this helps.
        Let me know if you need more help.
