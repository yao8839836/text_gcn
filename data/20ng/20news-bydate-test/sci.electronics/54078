Back in high school I used to work for a detailing company, and one of the
services we offered was an engine cleaning (remove all that oil BEFORE you
sell the car...  ;-}). Unfortunately, we did not have a high pressure
washer so we would use one several miles from the shop. On more than one
occasion after washing the engine, it would not start as water would have
gotten under the distributor (I would put a plastic bag around it to try and
minimize this), around the spark plug wires, etc and it would be nearly
IMPOSSIBLE to try and wipe all these areas down with a dry rag. The usual
solution was to carry a can of WD-40, and when the car wouldn't start to spray
all the likely areas and it would then start on the very first time.

It may be a myth, but it certainly kept me from being stranded at a car wash...
