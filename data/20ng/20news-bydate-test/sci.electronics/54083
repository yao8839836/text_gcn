What happens is that (I heard this discussed on "Northern Exposure") there  
is a molecular juxtaposition of the molecules in the battery and the  
molecules in the concrete.  This acts as an attractant to UFOs (actually  
their crew members) and they arrive at the scene of the battery/concrete  
combination.

Then they proceed to SUCK ALL THE ENERGY OUT OF THE BATTERIES!

Remedy:  Set the battery on a nonconcrete floor.
