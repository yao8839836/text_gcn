Laser holes are (or were) used to prevent someone from making exact copies 
of a disk. You do not want to write to the damaged disk, only read and use 
the programs.

I remember a program called Copywrite that could copy a disk with a laser 
hole in it. I think it simulates the laser hole. After copying the disk the 
program is, if necessary, used in conjunction with a program called Nokey or 
something. (The program tells you which program to use)

No solution.
