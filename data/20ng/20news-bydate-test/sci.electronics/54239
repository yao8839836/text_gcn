Why can't he record it legally?  It may not be admissable in court, but
recording for personal use is legal.  If he wants to play it for his ham
friend, that's legal too, as long as he doesn't charge admission.

It doesn't actually have to be 1500 watts at 100 feet.  I've heard radio
transmissions from concert security over guitar amps with no guitar plugged
in, and security uses radios transmitting 2-5 watts into a rubber duck antenna,
which acts more like a dummy load than an antenna.

Hey Bill, where were you three weeks ago when all this stuff was posted
