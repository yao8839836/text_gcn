Hi,  I have a few questions about laying out a PCB. I am using easytrax for dos
which is a great program. But what my question is When laying out traces what
thickness should they be? I am mainly designing low voltage low current boards
for micro controller apps. What should pad sizes be for resistors? I will be
turning to a commercial PCB maker to produce 1's of these boards and I was
wondering what is the minimum distance traces should be from each other. Well
any info would be great. Thanks.
