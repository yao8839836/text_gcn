This is a question aimed at those who have done some server code hacking:



I am attempting to add a working SaveScreen function to a new
server.  I have been able to get the screen to blank out properly, and through
debugging I can see that my savescreen function is being called with on=0,
which (for some arcane reason) means to blank the screen.

My problem is that this function is never being called again with on=1, even
after I have moved the mouse and/or typed some keys.  My question is:  what am
I likely to be missing that would cause this problem?  I copied the basic
design of my function from the existing versions:

static Bool next_savescreen(scr,on)
ScreenPtr scr;
Bool on;
{

  /* this was copied from the omron server code -- is it the right way? */
  if (on != SCREEN_SAVER_ON) {
		nextSetLastEventTime();
  }

  if (on == SCREEN_SAVER_ON) { /* Save user's current setting */
		next_save_screen_brightness = NXScreenBrightness(my_eventhandle);
		NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle, 0.0); /* Blank the screen */
  }
  else {											 /* Unblank the screen */
		NXSetScreenBrightness( my_eventhandle, next_save_screen_brightness);
  }

  return TRUE;
}

I can see in the server/os code where the screensaver is called to turn on the
saver, but I cannot find where it "wakes up" the server and unblanks the
screen.

Any tips/help would be appreciated.

Thanks.
