At the moment, I am using a Sun 3/80 (cgfour/bwtwo) with SunOS 4.0.3
and OpenWindows 2.0.

This configuration is slow and I can't run all the programs on OW2. For
example, when I start a mailtool from OW3 and display it on my OW2
display, I can't open the compose window.

I want to install an X11R5 or X11R4 server on my Sun and use xdm (yes,
we have xdm already running for other X-Terminals) to log in and start
the X programs.

Is there a "ready to go" binairy of the X11 server for my configuration
(I have read something about Xsun), or must I compile the X11 stuff by
myself?

Any help is welcome

	V. Smeets
