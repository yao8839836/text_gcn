I recently corrected the resolution on my Sparcstation by changing
/usr/lib/X11/xdm/Xservers from:
:0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 100
to:
:0 local /usr/bin/X11/X :0 -ar1 500 -dpi 85

I determined that my 19" 1152x900 monitor was 85 dpi by measuring the
active screen area and dividing by resolution.

However, this has caused my application fonts to behave strangely.
After some research, I believe this is caused by my applications
requesting fonts by Family, Weight, Slant, and Pointsize.  I believe
that X is grabbing the first font on the path with these characteristics
and displaying it.  Since I have only 75dpi and 100dpi fonts on my
path, the results are inaccurate.  I do have some Speedo fonts, but
not for the family I am using (Helvetica).

I think this is incorrect.  The fonts should always be provided in the
resolution of the display.  This never seems to happen unless you
explicitly request fonts by xres and yres!  This is true of both the
scaleable and bitmapped fonts!  For instance, the command

xfd -fn '-bitstream-charter-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'

Will invoke a 75dpi font (despite the fact that this is a Speedo font).

The command  

xfd -fn '-adobe-courier-*-*-*-*-*-240-*-*-*-*-*-*'

Will invoke a 75dpi font or a 100dpi font (depending on my font path).
Despite the fact that X knows my display is 85 dpi, and that it can
generate an 85dpi font for me!  Unless I my applications specifies a
resolution, X appears to pick a stupid default.

Is this a bug?  Is it a feature?  If so, why?  Is there anything I can
do to get around this problem?  People have suggested that I lie about
my resolution, and specify a single font path (75 or 100, not both).
This would at least make my app consistent, but I like being able to
look at rulers that appear in my paint application and say: "Yup, thats
an inch".  Anyone have a set of 85dpi bitmapped fonts I can use?
