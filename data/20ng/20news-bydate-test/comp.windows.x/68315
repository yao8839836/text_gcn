Granted it's nothing to loose sleep over, but this is Ethernet's tragic flaw:
the more activity (especially lots of tiny activity), the more collisions
happen and the performance gets exponentially worse...  I am just now
opposing ANY kind of waste of bandwidth under Ethernet.  Although in a polling
system it would not be so bad.
