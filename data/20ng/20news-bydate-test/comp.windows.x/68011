Try to get axe - It's a wonderful X based editor and much simpler to use than
emacs what is a overkill. Of course, emacs is no editor but a religion.

1) Don't call going from an Amiga to a IBM 'upgrade'
2) The Amiga Workbench did the job of a Desktop manager, and there is no
   really amazing good X Desktop manager in the Public Domain.
   (I'm currently writing one... but it's in very early stage)
3) xdtm may be a medium good replacement.
4) X associates icons with nothing. A number of X Window Managers associate
   icons with windows, in a way to ease window management.
   But this has nothing to do with icons of a Desktop Manager application.
5) The tool bitmap is there for simple icon drawing.
