                          The Andrew Consortium
          of the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon 
                         is pleased to announce

                          AUIS 5.1.1 for AIX3.2
                                 4/26/93

The Andrew User Interface System version 5.1 (our CDrom version) was
developed for AIX  version 3.1 on the IBM RS/6000 and many other
platforms.  To accomodate AIX version 3.2, we have created a patch to
the sources.  The patch and accompanying instructions for its
application can be retrieved at no charge via anonymous-ftp from the
internet host emsworth.andrew.cmu.edu (128.2.45.40) in the directory
./aixpatch.  For those without internet access, a 3.5" diskette can be
ordered for $10 by sending, or faxing, a purchase order to the address
below. 

The base 5.1 system can be ordered from us as a CDrom or ftp'ed from the
same host.

Note that this patch adds no additional functionality but simply allows
AUIS to compile under AIX3.2.

-----------

The Andrew User Interface System (AUIS) is a comprehensive environment
on top of X11 windows in which you can create, use, and mail multi-media
applications and documents.   A major advantage of AUIS is the
capability to recursively embed objects.  Thus, one can edit text that
not only contains multiple fonts, indentation, and other typography, but
also  contains embedded raster images, spreadsheets, drawing editors,
equations, simple animations, and so on. These embedded objects can
themselves contain other objects, including text.

AUIS has three components:

    The Andrew User Environment is an integrated and extensible set
    of applications beginning with the ez text editor, a help
    system, a system monitoring tool, an editor-based shell
    interface, and other editors corresponding to the various
    available types of objects. 

    The Andrew Toolkit (ATK) is a portable, object-oriented
    user-interface toolkit that provides the architecture wherein
    objects can be embedded in one-another.  With the toolkit,
    programmers can create new objects that can be embedded as
    easily as those that come with the system. 

    The Andrew Message System (AMS) provides a multi-media interface
    to mail and bulletin-boards.  AMS supports several mail
    management strategies and implements many advanced  features
    including authentication, return receipts, automatic sorting of
    mail, vote collection and tabulation, enclosures, audit trails
    of related messages, and subscription management. It also
    provides a variety of interfaces that support ttys and
    low-function personal computers in addition to high-function
    workstations. 

The current public release of Andrew, Version 5.1,  includes support for
the new Internet MIME (Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) standards
for multipart, multimedia mail.  A newer release, 5.2, for members of
the Andrew Consortium has numerous additional features including new
editors for drawings, images, fonts, and user preferences.


Remote Andrew Demo Service

You can try out Andrew from your own work station via the Remote Andrew
Demo Service.  You need a host machine on the Internet running the X11
window system.  You'll be able to compose multimedia documents, navigate
through the interactive Andrew Tour, and use the Andrew Message System
to browse through a few of CMU's four thousand bulletin boards and
newsgroups.

To get started with the Remote Andrew Demo service, simply run the
following command on your machine:

	finger help@atk.itc.cmu.edu

The service will give you further instructions.
