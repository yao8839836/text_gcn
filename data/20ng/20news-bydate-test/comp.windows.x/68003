If you already own all the "clone" equipment then there are lots of such
programs (see a current copy of Unix World Magazine).

*BUT*  your performance WILL suck lemons running an Xserver on a clone.
(From experience).  You would be much better off with an Xterminal if this
is a new install.  The performance will be at least four times better.
In addition it would be MUCH easier to install and use.  On top of that
they will cost about the same (price a clone with 4MB RAM, ethernet card,
very high performance graphics card, GOOD monitor, server software, TCP/IP
for clone software, mouse, keyboard, etc, etc, etc.... you spend a whole
lot of $$$$).

I can get 15" Tektronix XP11 terminals for under $900, and the performance
is over 80000 Xstones.....
