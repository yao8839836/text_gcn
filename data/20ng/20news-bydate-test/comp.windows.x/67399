Judging from the responses so far, I have not made clear enough in my
article quoted above that Imake-TeX is not for installing TeX, but for
*using* it. With Imake-TeX, you will never again have to fiddle around with
calling latex and its various utility programs (makeindex, bibtex). Simply
type "make" and your document's DVI file will be up-to-date. All you have
to do is to write a simple Imakefile and let Imake generate a suitable
Makefile for you. Here is such an Imakefile:

	#include "TeX.tmpl"
	PaperFormatA4()
	SimpleLatexTarget(document)

The generated Makefile provides the following commands:

    make depend:    Searching the TeX source files for dependencies like
                    \input{somefile}

    make dvi:       Generate an up-to-date DVI file

    make viewdvi:   Display it on your screen

    make ps:        Generate a PostScript version of your document

    make viewps:    Display it

    make clean:     Remove unnecessary things

    make veryclean: Remove even the DVI file

    make Makefiles: Generate Makefiles in subdirectories


If ...

a) ...this seems attractive to you,
b) ...you are willing to test Imake-TeX and send me a short test report,
c) ...you are willing to cope with a rudimentary English documentation
   (however, the German version is completed and included),

then you are invited as a beta tester. I am looking forward to your e-mail.
