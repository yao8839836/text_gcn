So what? I'm running emu on a 25 MHz 68020 box. I cannot make out ANY
difference in performance whether the cursor is set to blinking or
not (If you think about it a bit, a cycle of 400 ms is a hell a lot of
time for even the slowest PC). Since you would of course only enable
the blinking text cursor when your xterm has the input focus, this 
application is active anyway. To repeat it, a blinking text cursor
costs almost nothing in performance, it just needs some thought when
designing the xterm software.
