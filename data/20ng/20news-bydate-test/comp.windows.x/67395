I'm running xterm under X11R5, Motif 1.1, mwm and UNIX SVR4 on a UNISYS
386 based machine. My default shell is /bin/csh or the C shell. Whenever
I run xterm, I get the following message before the first C shell prompt:

Warning: no access to tty; thus no job control in this shell...

After this, I can't run any job control commands like fg, bg etc. Also,
I can't run another xterm from the command line of this xterm (I can only
launch additional xterms from a .mwmrc menu).

I'd appreciate some help with this problem, or pointers to where I can get
some help. By the way, my environment variable TERM is set to xterm.
