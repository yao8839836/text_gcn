We where following version of xv and I have been very surprise to discover that
the new version is a shareware: What a pitty !!! :-( .
What I found on the Inthernet was the freeware. I make myself a freeware and
I spent long time on it but I don't plain to make paid to use it. I think
if evrybody spent some time to make freeware, evrybody will be paid by the use
of other freeware.

Here we will stay with XV 2 and drop XV 3.
