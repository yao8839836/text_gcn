Hi,

I am running X11R4 on an IBM RS/6000 (AIX 3.2) and X11R5 on a Sun4 (SunOS 4.1).

Since I run X on both colour and black&white displays, I need different
values for the same resource, so I want to use #ifdef COLOR in my
application defaults files. However, cpp is only invoked by xrdb, and
not when the resources are loaded on demand.

Is there a proper solution to this?

So far, the only proper solution I've come to think of, is to create 2
different files in my ~/app-defaults/, say XTerm and XTerm-color, and
set my XFILESEARCHPATH to either $HOME/%T/%N or $HOME/%T/%N-color.
But that does not always seem to work (e.g. executing a remote shell
command without reading the .cshrc does not set XFILESEARCHPATH).

Furthermore, I thought of using #include "XTerm" in XTerm-color.
However, for resources in XTerm that I want to override in XTerm-color,
things are different on both machines. On a Sun, the FIRST found resource
is used (i.e. the one from XTerm, the b&w one), while on an RS/6000, the
LAST found value is used (i.e. the one from XTerm-color). What can I do
about it?

I have one last question: for the specification of XFILESEARCHPATH, I
can use %T, %N, %C and %S. %T stands for app-defaults, %N for the
resource class, but what do %C and %S stand for?

Thanks in advance for replying,
Marcel.
