I just got a bug report and a fix for this exact problem from
fisher@iscp.bellcore.com (Greg Fisher):

> GeometryManager is invoked by a child.  This will work correctly if
> the table widgets parent complies with the Xt protocols.  However, if

> 2. The table widget must query its parent for a new size having set
>    XtCWQueryOnly.
> 3. The parent must ignore the XtCWQueryOnly bit and resize the table
>    widget.  As part of the resize, XmpTableForgetProposedLayout is
>    called.  This will set tw->table.current_cols and
>    tw->table.current_rows to zero.

>    layout.  At the end, it will call XmpTableSaveProposedLayout.  This

He isolated the problem a proposed a workaround which seems precisely
correct.  Here is the new implementation of XmpTableNewProposedLayout
which will be released with the next update in 5 weeks:

Xmp/Table.c:

void XmpTableNewProposedLayout( tw )
    XmpTableWidget tw;
{
    XmpTableConsiderSameSize(       tw );
    XmpTableProposedColsAndRows(    tw );
    XmpTableQueryParentForResize(   tw );    /* query only, no resize */

    /*
     * Since we only made a query, we *should* still need to continue.
     * However, Motif is broken so that we actually may already have
     * been resized.  In that case, the proposed layout is already
     * forgotten, so we should just quietly exit.
     */
    if ( tw->table.resize_status == RSdueToRequest )
    {
        XmpTableMakeColsFitQueryWidth(  tw );
        XmpTableMakeRowsFitQueryHeight( tw );
        XmpTableGetProposedChildSize(   tw );
        XmpTableSaveProposedLayout(     tw );
    }
    /* else the resize has already been done.  Our proposed layout would
     * have been forgotten in the process.
     */
}

The XpTable the fix is identical, except of course for the names:

Xp/Table.c:

void XpTableNewProposedLayout(  tw )
    XpTableWidget  tw;
{
    XpTableConsiderSameSize(       tw );
    XpTableProposedColsAndRows(    tw );
    XpTableQueryParentForResize(   tw );    /* query only, no resize */
    /*
     * Since we only made a query, we *should* still need to continue.
     * However, some manager widgets are broken so that we actually may
     * already have * been resized.  In that case, the proposed layout
     * is already forgotten, so we should just quietly exit.
     */
    if ( tw->table.resize_status == RSdueToRequest )
    {
        XpTableMakeColsFitQueryWidth(  tw );
        XpTableMakeRowsFitQueryHeight( tw );
        XpTableGetProposedChildSize(   tw );
        XpTableSaveProposedLayout(     tw );
    }
    /* else the resize has already been done.  Our proposed layout would
     * have been forgotten in the process.
     */
}
