Hello!

We want to configure our X11R5 sytem (i486 33Mhz running BSD-like UNIX)
comming up with a chooser menu with different machines on it (works) an then
connect to them. But the only connection works is localhost!
An 'X -indirect <machine>' works very well!
The configuration:

		- starting the 'xdm' at boot time with no servers specified
		   in Xservers
		- starting the X-server at boot time with X -indirect localhost

	     ---> the chooser menu appears with the machines named in
		  Xacces bye
			'*	CHOOSER <machine1> <machine2> ... BROADCAST	
		- the number of users on this machines and the load is 
		    displayed correct

		- selecting an other machine than my own host the X-server
		   starts and nothing happens, after a time out the CHOOSER menu
		   appears again.

I know the xdm bug in X11R4, but all machines running X11R5

Please help
			Lars
