Use a workProc.  See XtAppAddWorkProc(3Xt).

You should split your drawing routnie up into small chunks (this
is the hard part).  Then, in the callback that starts the drawing,
you call XtAppAddWorkProc() to call your workProc the first time. 
Your workProc should be a function that returns a boolean...
TRUE when you are finished, and FALSE when you want to keep
processing.  If you return FALSE, the workProc is automatically
re-installed.  

Note that this method is better that using a time-out loop, since
events get processed in a more precedence-oriented manner.  If you
are using the same Ada bindings I am, however, you are hosed, and
should look into XtAppAddTimeout(3Xt).
