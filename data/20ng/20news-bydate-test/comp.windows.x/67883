Notes:
    Type 1 support only in OpenWindows 3.0.1 under Solaris 2.1.
    Antialiasing support - with colour OpenWindows 3 try pageview -aa -dpi 150
    Note that pageview uses the X11/NeWS server to interpret the PostScript,
    and thus won't run on an X terminal or other non-OpenWindows server.
    It's *not* enough to be runing an OPEN LOOK UI [tm] window manager such
    as olwm.

Requirements: OpenWindows 3 (??)
Other Products: IsoTeX, IsoFax, Power Base
Notes:
    An OLIT-based terminal emulator.  I couldn't get the demo version to
    give me a shell prompt, although it did look like it was a pretty fll
    vt340 emulation, with double-height characters, colour, fonts, grahics
    and so forth.
    With the Union Flag (the British flag) as their logo I somehow expected
    an English address, perhaps in Bristol...

Subject: OpenWindows 3 Ports

    Sun: SPARC, SunOS 4.1
    Sun: SPARC, Solaris 2 (actually 3.0.1?)
    others: none so far...

There are said (by Sun) to be two or three ports of OpenWindows either
available now or in progress.  Contact Anthony Flynn at Open Vistas
International (anthony@ovi.com) for more information.  (originally they
said 35, but perhaps they meant 3.5)

OpenWindows source is available - commercially, it costs about $5,000 for
the server, including TypeScaler and the toolkits; deskset (filemgr etc) is
another $25,000; ToolTalk is $40,000 or so.

    Let me stress that this is *not* fully tested, but seems to work
    pretty well.  Please let me know about any problems you find.
    Problems I already know about:
	Large buttons under *any* non-Sun X server (non-xnews; i.e. any
	standard MIT X11R[45] server) have the bottom of the button
	chopped off.  We're working on this one. :-)
    XView 3 is also available on the DEC Freeware CD, from DECUS.

 for listing this incorrectly.  A correct entry will appear as soon as I get
 the necessary information.  -- Lee]

Subject: XView 2 Ports

In general, there is no point in using XView 2 if you have XView 3 available;
it's a good idea to look for an XView 3 port first.  Moving from XView 2 to
XView 3 is usually simply a matter of recompiling, unless you've done
"dirty tricks" or used undocumented calls.
