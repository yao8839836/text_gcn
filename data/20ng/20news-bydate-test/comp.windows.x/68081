Subject: Resource listing for X11R5
Keywords: X11R5, resources


Does anyone know of a source (book, file, etc.) of ALL the standard 
resource names in X11R5? A small description of what the resource
IS would also be helpful, but not vital. Any help in which direction
to go would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks.
