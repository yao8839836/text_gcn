Yes, Xhibition is for the X Window System.  The X Window System Conference 
remains the largest and most complete conference devoted to X.  Nineteen full
and half day tutorials and thirty-six technical sessions over three days
provide huge amounts of information for X application developers.  Add vendor
exhibits and a Product Presentation track to provide information on what
folks can purchase today, and you have a complete show focused on X11.

Speakers at Xhibition 93 include: 

  Bob Schiefler, Lu Abel, Mark Ackerman, Paul Asente, Doug Blewett, 
  Donna Converse, Jim Fulton, Oliver Jones, Keith Packard, Ralph Swick, 
  Doug Young, and many others.

Xhibition is growing (fortunately for us:-) and we have added some additional
conferences.  Surveys that we have given have indicated additional topics of
interest.  These include: object oriented technologies such as the Object
Management Group's ORB and CORBA; C++ as it applies to X; client server
technologies such as DCE; threads; databases- object oriented and relational;
and (not surprisingly when you look at the audience) Windows NT.

With the bulk of the Xhibition audience (and the UNIX community) developing
applications for in-house or custom use, a new 32-bit operating system from a
player as large as Microsoft needs to be evaluated. With MS Windows on so many
desktops, and the price of computing power dropping, its successor needs to be
evaluated.  As corporations begin to look at NT, so must their developers and
suppliers.

The mission of the Xhibition technical conferences is to provide information
to the application developer and to the technology planner.  The NT Conference
at Xhibition is designed to do just that.  We worked with Microsoft to provide
the *only* conference this year specifically designed to show X and UNIX
developers the capabilities of Windows and NT.  If you aren't sure that NT has
what you need for your application development or systems deployment, this is
the place to find out.  Ask the folks from Microsoft, get them to show you
what you need.  Conference attendees will receive NT Software Development
Kits- to bang on, evaluate, and generally to see for yourself.

I hope this doesn't sound like an NT commercial (it should sound like an
Xhibition commercial:-).  I just want to reiterate that the Xhibition audience
is growing and Xhibition is growing along with it.  The industry is a
confusing place at the moment with UNIX, COSE, NT, DCE, CORBA, and all of
the other acronyms sprouting up.  Xhibition can help sort out the confusion.
