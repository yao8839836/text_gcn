I always use the following in my .[t]cshrc:

...
f ( $?LOGIN == 0 ) then
   source $home/.login
endif
...

and in .login:

...
setenv LOGIN 1
...

So I don't need to set all environment variables in my .cshrc, but they get
set if I login via xdm or xon | xrsh | rx and so on.

Hope this helps,

Bernward
