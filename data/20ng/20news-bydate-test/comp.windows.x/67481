In the list you mentioned, tgif handles everything except rotation and
any size text.  It only supports 90 degrees rotation.  Currently, it
supports 11 (X11R4 standard) font sizes.  However, it allows arbitrary
scaling of the entire drawing.  Effectively, it allows any font sizes, but
you can only have 11 different sizes per drawing.

Tgif takes up 850K (compiled with -O option) on a SPARCstation.  I was told
that it compiles under Linux, but I haven't tried it yet.  It works with
both color and monochrome X.
