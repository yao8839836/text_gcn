The patches for xv.h need to use ``#ifdef SVR4'' rather than the
overly complex ``#if defined(sun) && defined(SYSV)'' in order to
generically compile XV on i386SVR4Architecture.  Also, rand and srand
don't work very well--use lrand48 and seed48 to get better results.
Otherwise, xv-3.00 compiles just fine on my Esix System V 4.0.4 box
with XFree86 and gcc-2.3.3.  I just uncommented the gcc definition in
the Makefile, added -L/usr/X386/lib -I/usr/X386/include to the COPTS
line and modified LIBS to include -lsocket -lnsl.  Really John, if you
just use the Imakefile things like this don't even have to get
mentioned...
