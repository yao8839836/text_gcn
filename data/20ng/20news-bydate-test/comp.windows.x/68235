Xsun won't come up in color w/ this framebuffer! I am trying to use xkernel on
some of these 4/110s I have a freshly built Statically linkes copy of Xsun
that works just fine on cg6, cg4, bw2 type of framebuffers, but on the 4/110
that have this type of frame buffer all I get is Mono.

cgtwo0 at vme24d16 0x400000 vec 0xa8 
cgtwo0: Sun-3 color board, fast read

Here is what I've tried.

removing all the other /dev/cg* , /dev/bw , and /dev/fb and then selectivly
recreating /dev/cgtwo0. Xsun comes up mono. recreating /dev/fb, comes up mono,

I've tried Xsun & Xsun -dev /dev/cgtwo0.

PS Xnews will come up in color but it's not statically linked, and the
dynamically linked Xsun comes up in mono also.

PPS Xsun was compiled on w/ gcc 2.3.3 on a system running 4.1.3 and the 4/110
is also running 4.1.3.

Thanks n advance
