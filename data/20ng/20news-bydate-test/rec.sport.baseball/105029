I'm a little worried about this pitching thing.  6.08 is scarry even for
the first 16 games of the season.  Mesa (sp?) seems to be settling down. 
He pitched well against the Red Soxs, but The Rocket matched him.  I got a
chance to watch them play against California Wednesday and he pitched well
also.  Then the dam broke.  Wickander came in and promptly it was 6-1.  (3
run homer by Snow?).

I heard the guys on ESPN say that 7 of the TRIBE's top 10 prospects are
pitchers.  Anyone out there like to post who these guys are and where they
are?
The TRIBE is on ESPN again tonight against Oakland.
