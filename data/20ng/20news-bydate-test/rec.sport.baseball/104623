So what will happen when the tv contract runs out, considering networks
have been losing money on it?  Either ticket prices will go up, or someones
salary will be cut, or perhaps the local community or merchindise could make
up the difference.  Baseball is probably facing a dramatic drop in income
very soon, and someone will suffer (probably the fans from higher ticket
prices, but definitely someone).
