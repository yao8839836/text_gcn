Check your facts....Andre dawson's career Slugging pct is in the .480's
So is Winny's I would like to see your facts. Winny has probably done  
better than 129 points above with a carrer SLG of 480. Check on more  
important stats. DEFENSE, and HEART. BATTING AVERAGE. RBI's

Peak, and career, especially career, Winny ranks in the top 15 outfielders  
of all time. You are using BS to make your standings. And I would like to  
know where you are getting your numbers from.
