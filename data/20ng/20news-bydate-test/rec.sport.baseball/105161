That's the trouble: *what* peak years?  He wavers between excellent and
very good, with no real bell-shaped pattern in there.  1979 was a fine
year; 78 and 80 were merely really good.  With the Yankees, 84 (I think)
was the best; that was the one with the .340 BA.  

Of course, 1992 wasn't bad, either.  He's been in the bigs since 1973,
with a one-year intermission for surgery.  Though he doesn't have the
mix of skills that Pete Rose did, he's like Pete Rose in one way: he's 
not a natural hitter.  Winfield's swing used to be the ugliest thing
in New York, and that includes the Gulf+Western Building.  But his sheer
athletic prowess and physical size made up for a lot.  

Fascinating player to watch, even now.  Not obviously great in any one
way; but able to do quite a few things in surprising ways and at surprising
levels.
