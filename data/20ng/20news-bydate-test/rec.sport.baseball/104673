  If the relief pitcher didn't get 8 pitches, there wouldn't be enough time
to:

  1) Play "Hit The Road Jack"
  2) The Iron City Relief Pitcher Commercial
  3) The announcers to detail to us exactly what drove the 
      previous one from the game
  4) A detailed biography, both personal and statistical, of the 
      new guy throwing his 8 pitches.
  5) Get really cool super-slo-mo pictures for Diamond Vision to put up
      by said pitchers name and stats!
