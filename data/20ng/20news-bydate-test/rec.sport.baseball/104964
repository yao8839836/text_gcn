Yes, but

	(a) we were talking about peak level, not career averages
and
	(b) Clemente was the best fielding RF of all time, as far
	    as anyone can tell

I did a quick scan last night, looking for players with a peak comparable
to or better than Winfield.  In my quick-n-dirty subjective judgement, you
could make good cases for Ruth, Aaron, Ott, Robinson, Clemente, Kaline, 
Maris, Klein, Jackson, Waner, and probably a few others.  This is not a
knock on Winfield, but a comment on his consistency: all of those other
players had awesome stretches and very good stretches, while Winfield has
been more uniformly excellent.  Hall of Fame?  Absolutely.  Top-10 peak?
I'm not so sure.  Top 10 total career value?  Yes, almost certainly.
