Wiggins, Alan?

But that's besides the point.  I'm sure people would feel slightly
sympathetic for Rickey if he were killed.  But, they would also be
criticizing him a lot more for his actions.

Example?  

How about Jose Canseco?  He gets a couple of speeding tickets, and all
of the sudden his attitude is awful.  What the hell do speeding tickets
have to do with clubhouse influence anyway?  So why do sportswriters
talk about it all the time.

Or Brian Hunter and Keith Mitchell?  Both of whom had DWI problems
towards the end of last year.  (Two years ago?)  It was cited as a sign
of their immaturity, etc.  

Meanwhile, Dykstra almost killed both himself and Daulton, and I didn't
read any sportswriter complaining about that.  They may have talked
about how bad it was for the Phillies, but I NEVER read anywhere
criticism of Dykstra's character (or Daulton's intelligence, for that
matter) based on this incident.
