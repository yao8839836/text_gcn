I sent a version of this post out a while ago, but it was swallowed by

Oh no, I wasn't confused -- I understood that it was your personal
opinion.  But I thought we were discussing the need to shorten
games.  The arguments which declare this need seem to hinge on
the assertion that long games bore people and otherwise discourage
them from going to the ballpark.  I'd like to see if the increased
length of games has negatively affected attendance.  If it has, then
there *is* a problem, and something should be done about it.  If it
hasn't, then there *isn't* a problem, and there's no need to monkey
with things as they are.
