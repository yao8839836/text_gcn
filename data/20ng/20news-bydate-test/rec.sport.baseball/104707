But, Gary, for certain sofa tubers like myself, this is an advantage.  I
can watch the Pirates on KBL, the Mets on WWOR, the Braves on TBS, and the
mediots on ESPN at the same time, without missing anything.  (If something
impressive happens, I'll catch the replay :-) ).

So, I see (essentially) 4 games in 3 hours, instead of 1 game in 2 hours.
What a deal!
