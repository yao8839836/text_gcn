A guy who threw 240 innings with about .6 run lower ERA would have saved the
bullpen even more. Say, somebody like Frank Viola (238 innings).

Have you, by chance, taken a look at the boxscores from last year to
determine the accuracy of your account? I seem to recall Morris getting at
least 3 or 4 wins last year when the Jays came back from behind after they
had decided to pull Morris at the end of an inning.
