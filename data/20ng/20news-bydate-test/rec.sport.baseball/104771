At the time I didn't really want the Sox to sign either.  I was more
than a little worried about Viola's elbow.

But you *surely* remember my shout of relief when, after a week of
rumors that Morris was coming to the Red Sox, they ended up with Viola
instead.

Now I'm even happier.  Viola seems to have rebounded nicely.

How long did Viola sign for.  Three years?  I generally agree with
their policy of avoiding long-term contracts for pitchers.  But I
think they enforce it rather too strictly.  These days the premier
pitchers all sign three or four year deals.  Which leaves the Jays
with Morris and Stewart.  If the Jays want to compete for top free
agent pitchers, they will have to accept greater risks.

Any idea what the option year deal is for Morris?  Are there any
automatic activation clauses?  What is the buyout amount?f
