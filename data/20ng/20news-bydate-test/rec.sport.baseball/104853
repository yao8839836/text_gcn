	John Smoltz, Tom Glavine, German Jiminez, Dale Murphy, Bruce Sutter,
Pete Smith, Rick Mahler, Jim Acker, Jim "Break on Through" Morrison, Ron
Gant, Andres Thomas, Gerald Perry, Ozzie "The Aeneid" Virgil, Lonnie Smith,
Jerry Royster.
	How'm I doing so far?
	NOTE:  I am not a Braves fun.n

 On the other hand, ask any

	On the other hand , II like the Braves *much* more than the
Cubs.  And all I can name is Ron Santo, Ernie Banks, and Don Kessinger
from 1969, my favorite Cubbie season.

	Right.  I've watched enough Braves' games to know a great deal
of their players.  I like many of their players.  The only Cubs games I
get to see while living in New York are those against the Mets, and they
put me to sleep because, face it, watching guys like Rick Sutcliffe and
Luis Salazar doesn't put me at the edge of my chair.u

>	I'll consider Toronto AMerica's team before the Braves

	Actually, I notice a lot of anti-Toronto sentiment here in the
States.  Partly because of some of that post-Series arrogance (thanks
in part to "Upside-Down Flag" dork posts), partly because Roberto Alomar
is about as exciting as Swiss Cheese, and partly because, living in 
Baltimore during the winters, I've become so fond of O's fans (especially
those who call in to Rex Barney's radio show) that I have to side against
their most hated rivals.

	Sorry, but METS is spelled with an "M" and a "T".... =)
