Okay, I think we all agree that singles hitters should take a
strike or two and try to get on base any way they can.

So the "No Power/Impatient" guys have no excuse.
The "No Power/Patient" guys are doing the right thing.

Now the "Impatient/Power" guys (how could you leave out the Big Cat?).
Would these guys have a better slugging percentage if they took
more pitches?   Perhaps, but I doubt it.  If you tell Joe Carter
to go up there and take a few pitches, he will draw more walks, but
he also won't hit as many frozen ropes into the bleachers because
he is more likely to hold back on a pitch that he used to drive.

The "Patient/Power" guys?   Joe Morgan had a small strike zone and
Rickey Henderson has "a strike zone the size of Hitler's heart" 
so they get their walks based on the small zone.

Look at the other 5 guys: Thomas, Bonds, McGwire, Ruth and Williams.  Wow!
A lot of pitchers would rather nibble at the corners and maybe
walk these guys that to throw a clear strike to them.
The pitchers would do better (in my opinion) by just coming after
them with a good fastball for a strike on the first pitch, but pitchers
would rather nibble, go 2-0 or 3-1 and then get hurt.
