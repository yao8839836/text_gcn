Without opening this up for a sabermetric flame war, I would like to
question the notion that "sitting a rested player down" has any real
effect on his long-term performance.  Sure, if a man is tired and needs
real rest, then taking a break might be a constructive act.  Perhaps if
a man is mentally "strained", then sitting him down might help to the
extent that that helps him relax.  But I would like to suggest that
in the long run, players do slump, and benching is probably irrelevant.
