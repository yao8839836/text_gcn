Of course you can.  You just have to be careful about what conclusions
you draw.

Huh?  The 20's and 30's were the *worst* decades for great pitching.  Grove,
Vance, Dean, and not a whole lot else.  

As for the best all-around hitters, stat-wise, Ruth, Gehrig, Foxx, Greenberg,
Hornsby, Cobb, etc. all played before the 40's.  Stat-wise, the 60's were 
a graveyard for hitters.

So?  Sheffield also has better shoes.  More time between pitches.  You can
run the comparison, but there are *lots* of things to take into account.

Well, can we compare them or can't we?

Why?  We can compare players to the *standard* of their era; and we can
keep in mind era-to-era differences without throwing up our hands in
despair.

>way there is reasonable basis for comparison.

You haven't shown us what's *un*reasonable about the MAntle-Sheffield
comparison that you yourself did.
