trade	economic spotlight polish sanctions poland says u s sanctions have cost its economy billion dlrs and has made clear it wants washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses some of them are too sophisticated to convert into financial terms one banking source said but western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate they say it is blurred by the poor performance of poland s economy and dismiss the billion dlr figure as illusory sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under achieving they did have a bad effect yes but they only contributed to largely internal economic problems one said the u s imposed the measures and withdrew most favoured nation mfn trading status from poland in in retaliation for suppression of the solidarity free trade union under martial law the estimated cost to the polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the institute of national economy an offshoot of the central planning commission according to one western envoy an expert on polish economic affairs it extrapolated information on growth trends in trade with the united states as well as increases in credits from western commercial and government lenders but the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely he said dismissing the estimate as a theoretical projection based on a high point which has no real scientific evaluation a foreign trade ministry official said polish exports to the u s in the late s averaged around mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed imports have suffered slumping from around mln dlrs to mln as credits ran out poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the west last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted billion official figures show acknowledging that sanctions have lost poland important u s markets including agricultural equipment textiles chemicals and some foodstuffs western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons poland is accusing the west of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons said one expert it s an illusion based on a misunderstanding of western economy there s a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it another said adding that poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the s which were no longer today s reality describing the billion dlr assessment as nebulous one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new mfn status will have little impact on poland which has a hard currency debt of billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry mfn doesn t really mean anything only that poland will not be treated worse than other countries it will be difficult to regain access to the u s market because different forces are in play now said one western envoy he said polish products were not competitive and their quality was too low trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the u s japan and europe would also hamper poland s efforts to regain entry deputy foreign trade minister janusz kaczurba recognised this fact recently kaczurba told the official pap news agency recently making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult and in certain cases impossible in a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about mln dlrs while poland is unlikely to seek compensation it says it has a moral right to assistance from the u s which it says imposed the sanctions illegally but a western economist said the argument that u s sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the polish economy won t cut any ice the americans will just reply that the poles acted immorally in crushing solidarity nevertheless polish national bank head wladyslaw baka in talks in washington last week with the international monetary fund imf and world bank made it clear that poland was looking for a lead from the united states he was quoted by pap as saying that poland would meet its financial obligations to the united states but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners he stressed that the u s had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of poland s partners interested in the settlement of polish debt putting it more sharply one senior banking official blamed washington for obstructing talks with the world bank imf and paris club of western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role as a major superpower

interest	u s urges banks to weigh philippine debt plan the u s is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its third world debt strategy a reagan administration official said the official s comments also suggest that debtors pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms in addition he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a megabank where third world debt would be pooled and suggested the administration would support such a plan even though it was not formally proposing it at the same time however the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground the philippine proposal together with argentine suggestions that exit bonds be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan the official said in an interview with reuters all of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered said the official who asked not to be named in october washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the world bank and the international monetary fund imf were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations in return america called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation free economic growth the multilaterals have been performing well the debtors have been performing well said the official but he admitted that the largest third world debtor brazil was clearly an exception the official who played a key role in developing the u s debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the third world debt crisis we called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively the official said among those ideas the official said were suggestions that commercial banks create a megabank which could swap third world debt paper for so called exit bonds for banks like regional american or european institutions such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled and has been suggested by argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of billion dlrs he emphasised that the megabank was not an administration plan but something some people have suggested other u s officials said japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume third world debt this plan actively under consideration would differ slightly from the one the official described but the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the united states if the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go fine i don t think they ever will he pointed out that banks would swap their third world loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution meanwhile the official praised the philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than pct above libor the philippine proposal is very interesting it s quite unique and i don t think it s something that should be categorically rejected out of hand the official said banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of philippine investment notes these tradeable dollar denominated notes would have a six year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity the country would guarantee a payment of point over libor until now bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low the talks now in their second week are aimed at stretching out repayments of billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on billion of already rescheduled debt the country which has enjoyed strong political support in washington since corazon aquino came to power early last year owes an overall billion dlrs of debt but the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation a development until now unacceptable to the banks it s no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over libor from what existed before the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek some people argue that cutting the spread is debt forgiveness what it really is is narrowing the spread on new money he added he said the u s debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the philippines reuter

interest	national savings move points to lower u k rates u k interest rates look set to move lower even after monday s half point cut in bank base rates to pct analysts said citing as evidence the suspension of a british national savings issue yesterday the department of national savings effectively a treasury department unit yesterday suspended its nd issue launched in october and paying a high tax free pct on five year private investments between and stg a spokesman said the suspension was just a reaction to yields on national savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the market the move was followed by a surprise sell out within minutes today of a bank of england one billion stg tap issue the second such issue in as many weeks analysts noted they said the near instant sale of the entire new gilts issue for which the bank of england had required a high pct downpayment was clear evidence that the market thought rates had to drop sooner rather than later the sale of the tranche of pct treasury bonds due occurred in an active bullish gilts market as downward pressure on money market rates remained intact with the bellwether three month interbank rate down point at pct it coincided with another strong sterling rally which pushed the pound to four year highs against the dollar that government stock disappeared very quickly indeed said stephen lewis head of economic research at stockbrokers phillips and drew it is an indication that the market believes rates are going to fall further at least by a half point immediately after the budget on march and some people hope for more stockbrokers james capel said in a comment the move by the national savings department was of considerable significance it said the real message is that the decks are being quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut in bank base rates to pct materialises building societies have said a drop in bank base rates would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a reduction in mortgage lending rates lewis of phillips and drew said he too believed the national savings issue suspension may reflect new u k treasury policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut national savings has been competing too effectively with the building societies of late building society income has been depressed in recent months he said he and other analysts said chancellor of the exchequer nigel lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid on u k inflation underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in britain than in most other western economies with inflation seen rising well above four pct this year and above five pct in after last year s pct emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer prices lewis said a one point cut in building society rates would reduce inflation in britain by about pct but lewis and others noted that building societies had been complaining to the government about intense competition from national savings which they argued reduced the scope for early mortgage rate cuts the chancellor need not be worried about losing some psbr funding from national savings but he must be taking the building societies criticism to heart it looks like the national savings move reflects this one senior dealer said a savings department spokesman refused to comment on this interpretation saying the suspension of the issue was merely a reaction to the recent fall in u k interest rates which had pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with the rest of the market we are not politically motivated funding was just becoming too expensive and we don t need all that money he told reuters adding the department had suspended issues at least twice in the past when offered interest rates were above or below market rates he said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as u k money market rates continued their steady decline and income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion stg target set for fiscal ending march in the first months of fiscal national saving s contribution to government funding totalled billion stg compared with billion stg in the same period of the previous year official figures show figures for february out on monday are expected to show a further increase of between and mln stg pushing the total for months above target government officials said reuter

money-fx	after g round one goes to central banks central banks have easily beaten back the foreign exchange market s first test of the industrialized nations recent pact to stabilize currencies analysts said in active trading this week the market pushed the dollar sterling the canadian dollar and australian dollar higher but operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central banks signalled their displeasure so far g has been a roaring success said james o neill financial markets economist at marine midland bank na the central banks are sending strong signals that they won t tolerate any kind of momentum building behind currencies added a senior corporate trader at one u k bank on february the finance ministers and central bank governors of the u s japan west germany france and the u k the group of five plus canada signed an accord under which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around prevailing levels the agreement was viewed by many in the market as an attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable two year decline against major world currencies and initially traders indicated their respect for the accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower but by wednesday the dollar climbed to more than marks about five pfennigs above its levels the friday before the g accord the move was aided by indications that the u s economy picked up steam in february at the same time as the west german economy was regressing but dealers said the federal reserve bank of new york gave traders a sharp reminder that the g pact had encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines dealers differed as to whether the u s central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above marks or simply telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading conditions but the dollar quickly backed off it hovered today around marks the market was surprised that the fed showed its face so soon said marine midland na s o neill also on wednesday london dealers said the bank of england intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the u k currency rose to dlrs compared with dlrs before the g pact sterling along with the other high yield currencies like the australian dollar and canadian dollar was in favor after traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant to the paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays on dollar mark and dollar yen the pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving u k economy anticipation of a popular british budget on march and public opinion polls showing good chances for the incumbent conservative party in any general election there was a real run on sterling said anne mills of shearson lehman brothers inc sterling traded today around dlrs down from dlrs last night it slid to marks from yesterday and from a peak of about recently there s been some heavy profit taking on sterling mark ahead of next tuesday s u k budget said james mcgroarty of discount corp as speculators detected the presence of the u s and british central banks they acclerated their shift into canadian and australian dollars but here too they were stymied the bank of canada acted to slow its currency s rise the canadian dollar traded at per u s dollar today down from yesterday and the australian reserve bank using the fed as agent sold australian dollars in the u s yesterday dealers said the australian dollar fell to a low of u s cents today from a high of thursday analysts said the central banks moves to stifle sudden upward movement leave the market uncertain about its next step today the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a very tight range against the dollar for several months the dollar fell to yen from last night analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long sterling short mark positions established lately because of the change in perceptions about the health of the german economy the funds from those unwinding operations are ending up in yen a dealer at one u k bank said recent west german data have shown falling industry orders lower industrial output and slowing employment gains moreover the yen is benefitting as japanese entities who have invested heavily overseas for example in australian financial instruments repatriate their profits ahead of the end of the japanese fiscal year on march noting that the dollar yen rate is in a sense the most controversial one because of the large u s trade deficit with japan analysts said the stage could be set for another test of the dollar s downward scope against the japanese currency in its latest review of the foreign exchange market through the end of january the federal reserve revealed that it intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on january on that day the dollar fell as low as yen sure the fed bought dollars near the yen level in january but the market has to bear in mind that time marches on and the

crude	economic spotlight saudi arabia reshapes economy higher world oil prices coupled with a new realism ushered in by austerity could lift saudi arabia s economy after five years of falling revenue and growing budget deficits bankers and diplomats said the months ahead will prove critical as the government attempts a balancing act between defending higher oil prices and fostering recovery through a bigger role for the private sector economists said oil earnings could recover this year to about billion dlrs and nominal gross domestic product could grow by about three pct the first rise since but the economists said this will be possible only if the organisation of petroleum exporting countries opec succeeds in defending world oil prices and if saudi arabia is not forced to curtail output for too long saudi arabia is now keeping production down to defend opec s newly established dlr a barrel benchmark price oil minister hisham nazer told reuters output is running at about three mln barrels per day bpd well down on saudi arabia s opec quota of mln set for the first half of king fahd has stamped his personal authority on opec s new found determination to defend prices in a move western diplomats believe underlines the kingdom s need to secure a stable source of income for its economy saudi arabia still the world s largest oil exporter is a hugely wealthy country but the past five years of declining revenue have taken their toll economists estimate gross domestic product fell pct last year and pct in oil revenue last year when prices briefly dipped below dlrs per barrel probably totalled no more than billion dlrs compared to a peak billion in austerity is still the watchword but saudi arabia will not be allowed to dip further into recession the saudis can afford to draw down reserves temporarily to offset the worst effects a diplomat said in the short term the kingdom can lessen the impact of lower oil revenues and a gaping budget deficit by drawing on foreign reserves still put at around billion dlrs but such a policy cannot be pursued indefinitely bankers and diplomats said it would amount to fiscal recklessness in the longer term it also increases the dominance of the public sector at a time when the government is publicly urging private enterprise to take over the lead role in the economy bankers and diplomats said the government is well aware of the risks attached to this policy but is determined to tough it out on the oil front even if that means a short term depletion of reserves the budget deficit is targetted at a huge billion riyals or pct of total outlay the budget explicitly recognises the need to draw down reserves while foreign borrowing has been ruled out commerce minister suleiman abdulaziz al salim told saudi businessmen this week the government had carefully considered the need to stimulate the economy when drawing up its budget plans late last year it therefore took the bold step of withdrawing more than billion riyals from its reserves and pumping it into the economy he said reserves were built up during the late s and early s when saudi arabia s breakneck pace of construction and tales of high spending became legendary the shrinking economy has wrought huge changes in the fabric of the kingdom s private sector where poor management had gone unpunished in the easy days of the oil boom modern techniques of cost control have been introduced markets expanded and outsized labour forces and inventories cut back the expatriate workforce has fallen sharply the number of new bankruptcies appears to be declining but saudi banks hit hard by non performing loans to the corporate sector have become highly selective in extending new credit government moves to encourage lending and investigate company complaints about late public sector contract payments could boost confidence but recession has slowed the nation s industrialisation program and discouraged foreign investment private wealth is still very high and banks report more and more cash being placed on deposit as saudi arabia attempts to shift the weight of economic development from the public to the private sector one of the biggest tasks will be to convince businessmen to channel personal savings into industrial projects within the kingdom and refrain from the temptation to invest abroad reuter

moved rapidly into large bilateral surplus with the u s and major overrall trade and current account surpluses the morgan study says morgan expects taiwan s overall trade surplus to grow to billion dlrs in from billion last year and korea s to increase to billion dlrs from billion concern about the nics is not confined to the u s a lot of korea and taiwan s exports to the u s have been at japan s expense said richard koss at general motors corp february s paris meeting of six major industrial powers exorted nics to lower trade barriers and revalue currencies but this two pronged approach has drawn little response from the two nations so far and in any case will only work with a sizeable lag economists say the u s has not said how much it thinks the taiwan s and korea s currencies should climb the taiwan dollar which is pegged to the u s dollar has risen about pct since september while the korean won has risen about five pct but in real terms the taiwan dollar has been flat against the u s unit and the won has lost seven pct economists say we ve not seen any lessening of competition from those countries that we can attribute to currency changes said bethlehem steel s wendt and so far u s pleas for taiwan and korea to use their hefty export earnings to import more have had little effect moreover it is uncertain how far u s protectionism will get given the administration s free trade stance it s hard to see that anything will be passed much before year end and then the question is will it have teeth one economist said reuter

money-fx	u s fed explores commodity basket index the complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices the newest member of the federal reserve board says commodity prices are already considered by the fed in the making of monetary policy but they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by governor robert heller who joined the board last august he conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed but argues that such an arrangement particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries could reduce the volatility of exchange rates moreover it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves slowing changes in inflation his idea which many conservative economists find appealing has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by president reagan it would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation key indicators such as unemployment and the rise or fall of the money supply changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly discussed on and off for a long time the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base what is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes says heller in the past this anchor was gold but the united states went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies a return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the soviet union and south africa the so called fixed rate system scuttled in the early s is still considered unworkable in the present world but the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely adding vast pressures to the monetary system is also being widely questioned some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also for one thing there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy moreover some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement the poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that not surprisingly helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems treasury secretary james baker the reagan administration s chief economic architect has preferred to use the so called group of five industrial countries or sometimes seven as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters he appears convinced that officials from west germany france britain japan italy and canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing the heller approach while extremely complex could have a profound impact on the system ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates as envisioned by heller a basket of say major commodities ranging from wheat to oil would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis in times of rising commodity prices monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices montary policy might be eased he says he notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis moreover most commodity prices are produced consumed and traded on a world wide basis so that an index has a relevance for the entire world he says in addition commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions he says however he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the s because of action by the opec cartel would have to be discounted in such a system he says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities reuter

grain	economic spotlight china must preserve farmland if we go on using up farmland as we have done since there will be none left in years to grow grain on xu jinfeng a middle aged official in fengbang village on the edge of shanghai sums up the dilemma china faces as it tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same time let them get richer by building factories and new homes china has to feed one quarter of the world s population but only one seventh of its land is arable sharp increases in farm output since turned china into a net grain exporter for the first time in and again in but the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which has occurred at the same time has gobbled up arable land for factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them official figures show that china lost just under one pct of its arable land to other uses in and a slightly smaller amount last year it gained mln new mouths to feed during the two years we lost very little land prior to when the industrialisation began official xu said since then nearly all the families in the county have built new homes and many factories have gone up last year we lost land to a new railway line xu said but land losses in future should fall because nearly all families already have new houses she added the issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the peking leadership which announced earlier this month that china will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land for the first time this year the present situation of abusing occupying unlawfully wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious said an article in the official press explaining the new measures it has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland it said china has a large population and its land resources are badly deficient an official of the shanghai city government said county authorities could approve conversion of only hectares of arable land to other uses while anything more than that must be approved by the city government the peking government faces another major obstacle in its efforts to ensure china s people get enough grain to eat the prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low making it more profitable for them to grow other crops to offset this the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to buy the state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to china s mln city residents rural factories also subsidise grain output paying farmers bonuses to grow it some officials argue that the simplest solution to the problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices chen zuyuan communist party secretary of a village in the eastern province of zhejiang said the government listened too much to the demands of selfish city people and could raise city grain prices without any problem but the government has ruled out a price rise raising the price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social stability said a china daily editorial this month the shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the long term we must be very careful we have a very large population which is used to price stability and will object to price rises he said the problem is how to do it the shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with grain and consumed by city residents in addition the state faces the problem of inadequate investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular the official press has reported that farmers fear farm policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into building graves memorial halls for ancestors and homes under reforms introduced in the late s farmers sign contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land as the expiration date of the year contract is almost at the halfway mark farmers are beginning to worry about the future the china daily said in an editorial last month their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to use the land but not own it for most of the period of communist rule the land was organised into collectives where there was little room for individual initiative new measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency of government policies and make them interested in long term investment the newspaper said reuter
